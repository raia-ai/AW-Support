### Dynamic Optimization

The tutorial about the A+W DynOpt module focuses on the optimization of the production flow from planning of the lots to the finished product.

This chapter provides information on the following subjects:
- "Description of services" on page J-11
- "Problem statement" on page J-13
- "Optimization with A+W DynOpt" on page J-17
- "Working with Panorama" on page J-23

#### Description of services

There is significant savings potential during flat glass processing if you optimize the usage of stock plates during cutting.
- With the innovative optimization algorithm and intelligent and state-of-the-art stock connection, it is possible to place and cut different types of glass in alternation.
- With the use of an intermediate buffer, it is possible to optimize, cut, and sort the contents of the intermediate buffer dynamically.
- The activation of cutting tables with optimized cutting patterns directly from the optimization also speeds up the work process.

A+W DynOpt is a complex system network of various hardware and software components:
- Cutting table(s)
- Stock and residual plate stock
- Intermediate buffer and sorting system
- A+W Production for work preparation
- A+W Realtime Optimizer for online optimization on the table
- Panorama and A+W Production Cockpit for overall control and visualization of the system.

*Fig. J-1 Production view in A+W Production Cockpit*

#### Cut planning with A+W DynOpt

If the production batches are enabled in A+W Production, they can be imported into A+W DynOpt. The batches are enabled for import in the A+W DynOpt Editor and imported by the A+W Realtime Optimizer module. This is how these batches are incorporated into the dynamic optimization.

These imported and enabled batches are checked constantly. Here the A+W DynOpt batches are suspended completely and re-optimized dynamically taking into account different aspects, e.g. to better combine the same glass types or bring forward lites with a higher priority. The cut patterns calculated are visualized by A+W DynOpt per cutting table.

*Fig. J-2 Visualization of the cutting patterns in A+W DynOpt*

The lites cut are placed in an intermediate buffer from which they are then removed in the original sequence. This procedure offers the following benefits:
- A continuous stream of glass flows in the correct production sequence.
- The best possible yield results are achieved.

If you are working with a residual plate stock, suitable residual plates can be used instead of relying on stock plates. In addition to a good optimization result per cutting table, this procedure increases real yield and you can significantly reduce the residual sheet stock.
⇨ "Real yield" on page J-18

#### Problem statement

Operations in the glass business are currently being confronted with new challenges: Customers are demanding an extremely wide variety, very short delivery times, and quick deliveries. Added to this is a large number of rush orders. At the same time, the delivery quantities per customer and route are sinking.

The consequences of this situation are:
- The lot sizes are getting smaller and production must constantly be re-planned.
- Greater flexibility in production requires the following problem solutions:
  - More residual glass must be managed for the optimization of cutting.
  - Increased effort for handling of the lites.
  - Due to the smaller lot sizes from detailed planning, the room for play in the optimization for cutting is smaller.
  - This affects current yield as well as real cutting, for which the yield is regarded across the year. This real yield specifies the total quantity/area of unusable glass.
  - Overall, this results in a yield that is up to 10% lower.

A+W DynOpt reacts to these requirements with a flexible solution.

*Fig. J-3 Optimization methods*
*Fig. J-4 Lot size conflict*
*Fig. J-5 Example: Wide range of variants and quantities processed*

This graphic presents a simplified comparison of optimization using a standard method and with A+W DynOpt. Both approaches will be described in more detail below.

**Standard optimization**
- Cutting
- Fixed production sequence
- Type by type per lot
- Temporary storage
- Manual re-sorting
- Production line 1 -> Rack
- Production line 2 -> Rack
- Shipping

With the previous solution approach, all areas of production were optimized one after another. Under the current conditions, following optimized production, great work is required in shipping, which people try to eliminate with a lot of manual labor. For because of the wide range of variants and short reaction times, the lites get jammed up on the racks. This requires close attention from the workers in shipping and increased work when assigning the lites to the orders.

With this fixed work organization, the work preparation attempts to find appropriate lot sizes. Exceptional cases, such as broken lites and rush orders, are very expensive since these must generally be cut by hand.

However, efficient production must be controlled so that the processing steps are run through seamlessly for each lite -on through to direct packaging, where the finished lites are packaged directly without temporary storage and can be loaded onto the truck. Direct packaging thus has an enormous influence on the entire production.

**A+W DynOpt**
- Cutting
- "chaotic" dynamic
- Dynamic buffer
- Automatic sorting out in production sequence
- Production line 1
- Production line 2
- Shipping

**Lot size conflicts**
The lot size conflict is well-known in the glass industry. The flexibility and yield must be sounded out via the lot size. In the graphic you can see that the yield sinks with greater flexibility. With a very high yield, flexibility approaches zero.

At the same time, due to the wide range of variants, there are organizational problems in cutting:
- The cut lites must be stored somewhere temporarily. The dynamic buffers after cutting are thus more important than before.
- The residual plates must be managed.

The question of lot size conflict and residual plates must be checked constantly - production requires a dynamic solution that reacts constantly to current events.

#### Optimization with A+W DynOpt

In order to be able to work completely automatically and dynamically, A+W DynOpt poses requirements of the hardware:
- A buffer and a sorter are used on the cutting table.
- The cutting tables must offer the greatest possible flexibility, e.g. with several cutting heads.

A+W DynOpt is configured in each case for the hardware used so that the buffer is always sufficiently filled. Because cutting is faster than the lines, there is room at this workstation for interruptions, e.g. if the stock must be entered because of a glass delivery.

A+W DynOpt is a close-range optimization, that is, the optimization always relates to the current situation on the cutting table. Here current events are considered, e.g. broken lites and rush orders. A+W DynOpt Always regards the future supply of batches and lots and automatically optimizes anew.
⇨ "Dynamic time line" on page J-19

**Optimization of the batches**

The optimization and production are organized in batches and lots:
- A batch is the quantity of glass that should be regarded as a group and put into production. It can include different types of glass.
- A lot is a sub-quantity of a batch. A lot combines the lites that are produced at the same time under the same production conditions on the same machine.

One lot is generated for each glass type on each table. The sequence of the individual plates within the batch is determined according to the best possible flow. Thus different types of glass are placed on the tables.

> **Example**
> A batch contains the glass types float 4 mm and float 5 mm.
> They follow one another directly and should be cut on table 1.
> From the sequence float 4 - float 5 - float 4, the following lots arise:
> Lot 1 - float 4 - part 4
> Lot 2 - float 5 - part 1
> Lot 1 - float 4 - part 2

The detailed and rough planning of A+W Production provides the basis for the optimization with A+W DynOpt. Here the batches planned in detail are suspended and recalculated. The detailed planning also considers the storage spaces for the cut lites. This planning is retained in A+W DynOpt.

The production batches are only regarded as binding if they serve the production flow. The final production batches therefore are created only after cutting — which solves the lot size conflict to a significant degree.

If A+W DynOpt suspends the batches from the detailed planning, the program retains the sequence for a batch. This means that the lites are transferred from the buffer to cutting to the storage spaces planned by detailed planning. The lites are thus still organized for the subsequent processes after cutting. The lites are removed from the buffer as they are required in subsequent processes. The empty slots can then be filled anew.

Therefore A+W DynOpt stands between the processes and communicates with A+W Production, the database, all A+W Production terminals, and all connected components, e.g. cutting tables, buffers, sorting systems, residual plate buffers. A+W DynOpt handles the control and communication with all participating software and hardware systems, monitors state data, and reports relevant results and events, e.g. breakage.

The "Panorama" handles the mapping of the machine model.
⇨ "Working with Panorama" on page J-23

**Triggers for re-optimization**

A+W DynOpt can suspend the not-yet-transmitted plates and re-optimize them, e.g.:
- Broken lites are in the breakage pool.
- The batch sequence is changed due to manual interventions or defined priorities.
- New batches have been imported.

Normally, this suspension is always done after a plate change. After that, the newly-available total quantity of lites is optimized.

**Real yield**

For the optimization, A+W DynOpt orients itself according to the true yield. This is not just the optimization of the cutting, but an optimization that makes the entire production more profitable.

This approach refers not just to individual yield optimizations, but keeps an eye on the entire work day, how many stock plates have gone into production, and how many residuals were created in the process. In addition, A+W DynOpt considers and reduces the effort for handling the lites – thus also reducing the share of broken lites and scratches.

Thanks to this comprehensive view, individual steps by A+W DynOpt may at first not appear conclusive. However: A+W DynOpt allows advancing to a degree of optimization that you would not achieve with customary planning. Existing or new residual lites are used better and with higher priority for cutting.

The more yield and fewer residual plates, the higher the material utilization and the lower the material costs.

#### Dynamic time line

In A+W DynOpt the clusters form an endless time line on which the lites are arranged and planned. A cluster is generally the quantity of a slot cart. The optimization works through this time line down to cutting. The lites that are needed earlier in production are sorted into the time line earlier and thus have a higher priority. Gaps are filled with the later lites in order to get a good yield.

*Fig. J-6 Cluster on the time line for dynamic optimization*
- **A** Dynamic buffer for cut lites
- **B** Cut clusters (table 1)
- **C** Cutting
- **D** Optimized clusters (table 2)
- **E** Clusters can be optimized further ("re-optimized")
- **F** Clusters are not yet optimized (filler lites)

This figure shows the optimized batches that batch through cutting and are placed into the buffer. The batches planned in detail form the start for the program. The cut lites that are output from the dynamic buffer form the output.

The red line indicates cutting:
- The clusters to the left of the red line (light blue) are already cut and are placed in the buffer.
- The clusters to the right of the red line are not yet cut and are broken down into three priorities:
  - The dark blue clusters are completely optimized and are cut next with high priority.
  - The yellow clusters are not yet completely optimized and can still be filled up with fill lites (green).
  - The green clusters are not yet optimized. With a new optimization of the yellow clusters, they can be used as fill mass.

If the lites of a cluster are cut, they are placed in the buffer and A+W DynOpt executes a new optimization. Some lites from the next cluster will already be cut, because it was taken as fill mass for the previous cluster. The rest of the current cluster will be cut.

The goal of the optimization is that every production line is always replenished. Therefore, there must be as much flow out of the buffer as possible. Important here is that an individual time line is formed for each output. A+W DynOpt tries to use these as evenly as possible.

The principle goes like this: The next cutting of a plate must create as high a flow out of the buffer as possible. This is only achieved if lite and counterlite for IGU or LSG are in the buffer. Here, in the next step cutting plans are created and in the second step these cutting plans are optimized so that the lites that belong together for IGU/LSG production are available at the same time.
⇨ "Buffer system" on page J-21

*Fig. J-7 Optimized batches and buffer reservation*
- **A** Newly-optimized batches
- **B** Special glass, waiting for cutting
- **C** Cut lites in the buffer
- **D** Cutting plans

In this figure you can see that spaces are held free for special glass if it is required, e.g. for IGU production. The optimization must consider that these lites are not cut so late that the IGU line can no longer be operated.
⇨ "Buffer reservation" on page J-22

A+W DynOpt also uses residual plates when optimizing. Thus, in comparison to customary production, it is possible to achieve significant material savings.

Reported broken lites are automatically taken up into the optimization, so that as quick a remake as possible can be guaranteed. Each new optimization is linked to triggers, e.g. a specified state or a particular number of broken lites. In addition, all batches that have not yet been transferred to cutting are completely suspended and re-optimized.
⇨ "Optimization of the batches" on page J-17
⇨ "Dynamic time line" on page J-19

#### Buffer system

Production with A+W DynOpt only makes sense with a suitable buffer. This requires a buffer system in which lites are stored temporarily in sufficient quantities and can be output to the lines at the right time. Thus the buffer also ensures production on the lines if cutting stops.

A+W DynOpt is specially configured to the customer-side hardware. This also applies for already-existing buffers. A+W DynOpt represents the logical buffer in that is plans the lites that belong together. The physical reservation of the buffer is specified by the manufacturer of the buffer. A+W DynOpt is always adjusted so that it exploits the existing buffer optimally.

A+W DynOpt interacts with the buffer system and exchanges data. Here, among other things, the reservation of the slots is configured so that it is adjusted locally to the production. Lites that are determined for an IGU line are also stored near the IGU line.

In addition, the quantities of individual slots in the buffer can be locked. Slots can also be locked completely by the manufacturers, e.g. if they are damaged and cannot be used.

#### Buffer reservation

In the buffer, there is a distinction between the logical and physical reservation of the buffer.
- The logical reservation specifies how lites must be kept together in slots. This is the planning specification for the machine manufacturer.
- With the physical reservation, the slots are assigned as the logical reservation permits or requires this. The cut lites always batch according to the specifications of the logical reservation in the slots.

The cutting plans are only transferred to cutting if the space for the lites in the buffer is guaranteed.
The *Cutting overview* dialog displays the reservation of the buffer.

*Fig. J-8 Buffer overview in A+W Production*
- **A** Status of the marked slot
- **B** Marked slot
- **C** Green: filled slot
- **D** Lites physically on hand (blue)
- **E** Gray: reserved slots for lites that are expected

Under the slots, the status of each slot is displayed:
- White: the slot is completely free.
- Gray: the slot is reserved.
- Dark green: the slot is reserved, but the lites are not yet ready for transport out.
- Light green: the slot is reserved and the lites are ready for transport out.

Missing lites generate gaps in the time line. The buffer gets ever fuller because production waits for the lites. If the buffer becomes too full for optimal yield, it can become absolutely necessary to produce a particular lite. In this case, it must be considered that the yield is not optimal, however production does not come to a standstill.

If there are no more gaps in the time line, the buffer gets emptier. Thus the possibilities for optimization and yield increase again.

#### Working with Panorama

The Panorama handles the mapping of the machine model and communication with the machines. This is the central machine control and communication component of A+W DynOpt.

The result of the optimization is written to the database and forms a so-called step. These steps are read in by the A+W Realtime Optimizer, which then generates the data for Panorama. Panorama uses this data to control the system.

**Residual plates**

Panorama reports residual plates from the residual plate buffer to the A+W Realtime Optimizer. It queries the residual plate buffer via Panorama to see if this plate can be stored. If so, the data is adjusted by the A+W Realtime Optimizer and transferred to Panorama.

**Buffer system**

Panorama manages the buffer system logically and checks whether additional cutting codes may be transferred. If all lites of the plate fit into the buffer system, the cutting code is generated and transferred to the machine. According to the specifications of the A+W DynOpt core and the optimization, Panorama also controls which lites may be placed together in a buffer slot.

**Rejects**

Panorama receives item and breakage reports about the entire system from the machine. Rejects that arise during transport in are remade automatically.

Essentially Panorama always tries to update the rejects so that the unit can still be placed complete at the output. For this, A+W DynOpt has the following modes for how plates with rejects can be prioritized:
- The plates are sorted based on the next required normal lites at the output. Here plates that consist only of rejects are placed at the end of the sequence.
- The plates are sorted based on the next required normal lites at the output. Here plates that consist only of rejects are placed at the beginning of the sequence.
- If based on the buffer reservation it is possible, all plates with rejects are placed at the beginning of the sequence. If, due to the buffer load, A+W DynOpt cannot accept such a sequence, units must be completed as quickly as possible in order to reduce the buffer load.

**Special lites**

Lites that do not come from the optimization can be fed directly to the output, e.g. Purchased lites or hand cutting. If necessary, these lites can also be fed via an individual input.

**Production sequences**

For the production batches transferred, Panorama manages production sequences with the information about units, lites, sequence, and status of a batch.

Based on this information and the sequence of the sequences, Panorama commissions lites for transport out into an outlet. Panorama also receives item and breakage reports on the outgoing transport line.

### Working with A+W DynOpt

A+W DynOpt requires only an employee with a comprehensive view of production. This employee can initiate changes in the production flow and A+W DynOpt executes the changes for the best possible performance.

The program channels the imported batches independently from input to output as long as enough batches are imported and no interventions, e.g. due to rush or broken sheets, are required.

The sequence of the batches can be changed with A+W DynOpt. For example, lots can be pulled from the IGU line if this is necessary. The employee then requests the lot in question on the screen and A+W DynOpt reorganizes the lot.

The change is made with the maximum possible advantages and disadvantages at this time. The consequences of the change, e.g. a batch pushed up, is visible directly on the screen.

The employee must be able to assess the consequences of his interventions. A+W DynOpt offers tools with which the employee can maintain an overview and assess his decisions:
- The A+W DynOpt Editor
- Tab *XOPT-ON Dynamics* of A+W Realtime Optimizer
- *Cutting overview* of A+W Realtime Optimizer
- A+W Production Cockpit With configurable dialogs
  - This control desk with various indicators created individually for a A+W DynOpt project is an optional add-on module that is not described here. As a central control desk, it displays the state of the overall system, e.g. glass flows and bottlenecks, output, buffer reservations, etc.

*Fig. J-9 Program dialogs for working with A+W DynOpt*
- **A** The A+W DynOpt Editor
- **B** XOPT-ON Dynamics
- **C** Cutting overview

The user must interpret the indicators and dialogs. Thus A+W DynOpt becomes visible and the employee knows what the current status of production is.

> **Example: effective work with A+W DynOpt**
> The shift manager sees which glass types in what quantities the orders include. He recognizes that, for example, only three more lites must be cut from 8 mm LSG, but in the later course of orders, 2 additional lites of the same type will follow.
>
> Therefore, the appropriate order with these lites must be imported into A+W DynOpt so that the program detects these lites of the same type and pulls the cutting of the lites of the same type together.
>
> For this, enough batches must have been imported so that A+W DynOpt can plan with maximum yield. If there are too few batches in the system, the program can only plan with a little data and the yield is reduced.

#### A+W DynOpt Editor

A+W DynOpt works independently in the background, however the input data must be made available manually. The *A+W DynOpt Editor* dialog is available for this; use it to reach all additional dialogs.

With the editor, you specify the work quantity to A+W DynOpt. With the sequence of the imported batches, you specify their priority for processing.

*Fig. J-10 The A+W DynOpt Editor*
- **A** Batches from A+W Production
- **B** Batches transferred to A+W DynOpt
- **C** XOPT-ON dynamic batches
- **D** Details about the selected lites
- **E** Setting for display on the time line
- **F** Dynamic time line

On the top portion of the dialog, you import and prioritize batches. On the lower portion of the dialog, you see the dynamic time line and the status of each batch.

**Status colors for the batches on the dynamic time line:**
- **Green:** Lites of the batch are not yet optimized. Status 0.
- **Yellow:** at least one lite of the cluster has been optimized. Status 100.
- **Blue:** all lites of the cluster have been optimized. Status 200. If there are no more changes and there is no new optimization, the lites are cut this way.
- **Light blue:** the entire cluster has been cut.

**Sequence of the work**
With the following work, you can monitor the dynamic optimization:
- Import batches into A+W DynOpt.
- Get an overview:
  - Dynamic time line on the *A+W DynOpt-Editor* dialog
  - Configured dialogs in *A+W Production Cockpit*
  - *XOPT-ON Dynamics* tab
- Send cutting codes to the cutting tables on *Cutting overview*.

**Importing batches**
Import enough batches that A+W DynOpt can plan optimally and the dynamic time line does not batch empty.

**Prioritizing batches**
On the *Edit batch sequence* dialog, you change the prioritization of the batches. Critical for the prioritization is the answer to the question: Which lites have to be finished first?

Here the speed of the cutting tables and the glass types play a role, e.g. can float be cut more quickly than LSG. A+W DynOpt automatically reaches further into the future for the LSG cutting. The planner must only be aware that he distributes the share of batches with LST somewhat across the prioritization.

The LSG gets a jump on the cutting so that both glass types land in the buffer at the right time and are available on the lines for further processing.

**Rejects**
Rejects are channeled automatically by A+W DynOpt as soon as they are reported by a scanner to a A+W Production terminal or other programs.

#### Prioritizing rush lites in two steps

If you would like to channel rush lites quickly through production, prioritize the lites on the *Edit batch sequence* dialog in two steps.

You should only change the batch sequence within the same status, that is, drag a batch with a green status up to a maximum of the top of the batches marked in green. If you shift a batch over status limits, this change affects the entire process.

A+W DynOpt can decline a prioritization under some circumstances if it would cause problems in cutting or in the buffer.

The prioritization of batches cannot be executed as long as an optimization is running.

*Fig. J-11 Editing batch sequence*

On this dialog you edit the sequence of the batches.
Status colors of the batches on the *Edit batch sequence* dialog:
- **Green:** no cluster of the batch can flow out of the buffer.
- **Yellow:** at least one cluster of the batch can flow out of the buffer.
- **Red:** all lites of the batch can flow out of the buffer or are already flowing out.

**First step**

In the first step, you shift the rush lites to the desired position before cutting on the *Edit batch sequence* dialog.

You can drag the batch to the top of the status to which it belongs, that is, a batch marked green to the top of the batches marked green.

*Fig. J-12 Prioritization of the rush lites, step 1*
- **A** Dynamic buffer for cut lites
- **B** Cut clusters (table 1)
- **C** Cutting
- **D** Rush lite

The batch is then displayed in the appropriate place on the time line. The batch is now handled with high priority. At the same time it is ensured that the best possible optimization is guaranteed by A+W DynOpt. If you were to place a batch right at the start, A+W DynOpt would no longer have the opportunity to optimize as well as possible. In addition, the flow could stop.

**Second step**

In the second step, you shift the rush lites cut to the desired position after cutting on the *Edit batch sequence* dialog.

If the batch is cut, it is marked in red. In the second step of the prioritization, you can drag the batches marked in red to the top. Thus the lites are the next ones taken from the buffer and channeled into the lines.

*Fig. J-13 Prioritized rush lite*
- **A** Cut rush lites in the buffer
- **B** Cut rush lite
- **C** Cutting

The batch is then displayed as cut on the time line and shifted into the buffer.

#### Tracing the result

*Fig. J-14 A+W Production Cockpit, batch overview*

You get the most effective display of batches and individual lites on the *Batch overview* tab in A+W Production Cockpit. This way, you can trace where the lites are and change their prioritization.
