## 1. Cutting table
This chapter describes how to implement a cutting code driver package in an A+W Production and A+W Business Pro environment. Requirement is the base database from MarketSolutions. For other databases, the document may differ.

### 1.1. Configure cutting table in A+W Production
Defining a new machine is made in the machinery allocation (MZO). Important is that the **Component-ID** cannot be adjusted later. This ID creates a new data record to be found in **[Master Data / Machinery / Tables]**. The new machine ID must not exist in the machinery allocation.

The configuration of the table parameters can be made via MZO. Below, you will find the description via A+W Production Machine Dialog. You will find the component IDs to be used in the following description.

In case of questions how to configure a machine in the machinery allocation, please read the documentation regarding machinery allocation.

**ID Table**
Location: **[Master Data / Machinery / Tables]**

The unique ID of each cutting table is named in the standard database consecutively `TB1` ... `TBn`.

**Overview ID MZO, Machine and Registration Point**

| MZO ID | Machine ID | Registration Point | Release Dialog | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 110 | TB1 | 110 | TABLE1 | Cutting Table 1 |
| 120 | TB2 | 120 | TABLE2 | Cutting Table 2 |
| 150 | TB3 | 150 | TABLE3 | LAMI Cutting Table 1 |
| 190 | TB4 | 190 | | Manual Cutting |

### 1.1.1. Integrate Cutting Table into JobRelease
Location: **[Configuration / ALCIM / Release Dialog / Tables]**

For each cutting table, a `TABLE` action has to be defined. The actions are numbered consecutively while they are added and have to be allocated afterwards to a respective button in the release dialog.

The behaviour of the cutting plan printout is also defined here (more about that later).

**The Most Important Switches**

*   **Lot type**
    Lot type of detailed scheduling: always `100`

*   **Machine ID**
    MZO ID of machine:
    *   110, 120,... = Table1, Table2,...
    *   150, 160,... = LAMITable1, LAMITable2,...
    *   190 = Manual Cutting

*   **Driver directory**
    Directory of driver package, e.g. HEG. This directory has to exist under `$ROOT$\RELEASE\TABLES\`

*   **Parameter XOPTC_NETZ**
    Path for machinery code. For output on disc (parameter `XOPTC_DISK`) a message appears to insert the disc. Per default the output is to network in `$SERVERDIR$\PROD\`

*   **Parameter XOPTC_OPTI_LOS**
    *   `0` = one cutting code per lot
    *   `1` = one cutting code per batch (this is not possible for each driver)

**Machine code output for all machines**
It is possible to process all machines of a lot type with one configuration instead of using configurations for each machine. Therefore the switch **Machine ID** has to set to `0`. In the past a special script `$SERVERDIR$\SCRIPTS\JobRelease_AllForType.VB` was need, but actual this will work with the standard script `$SERVERDIR$\SCRIPTS\JobRelease.VB`.

**Pro:** In Dialog Release you need just one button for IG line and one for spacer bender.

**Contra:** The machine code of all IG lines or spacer benders will be saved to one directory. This can be adjusted by changing the `PostCreationScript` for the machines via `XL_JobRelease.CFG`. This is beyond the standard.

**Print Cutting Plan**
Cutting plans can be print via Release or displayed on screen. The printout has to be configured for each cutting table.

*   **Parameter XOPTB_ALL_LAST**
    Refers to printout, do you want to print all cutting plans or just the last one and with or without summary.

*   **Parameter XOPTB_PRINTER**
    Printer for cutting plan. The variable `<DR1>` uses the printer that can be selected for lists during release.

*   **Parameter XOPTB_DISPLAY_PRINTER**
    This switch controls whether to print or do display the cutting plan. Since the user want to decide this during runtime, the variable `<PrinterDisplay>` will be entered per default and a combo box in dialog Release controls this.

*   **Parameter XOPTB_PARAMETER**
    Here you can enter additional parameters that change the behaviour of the cutting plan printout, e.g. to reflect the cutting plan at X or Y axis using `/MPX` and `/MPY`.

### 1.2. Configure cutting table in A+W Business Pro
Cutting tables are configured at the machine in A+W Business Capacity planning **[Capacity planning → Master Data → Organisation → Machines]**

In the dialog you set the options for the cutting table which are import for optimization too. You set an output directory, were cutting code will be stored and you select a machine code.

Machine codes with a number smaller than 1000 are standard machines and can't be changed. If you generated a new machine, the new machine will be copied of the selected one and gets a new free number greater than 999.

The `Keyword` setting is important. The minimum lengths are 5 digits. This will be the name of the directory where the driver files are stored. The directory is generated automatically if a new cutting driver is entered. The content of the directory are the files from the template directory of the copied machine, BAT file renamed to the new directory.

```sql
SELECT * FROM [SYSADM].[PROD_MACHINECODE] WHERE [MACHINETYPE] = 1 ORDER BY [MACHINECODE];
```

**Output to floppy disk**
A+W Business Pro doesn't know if this is an Output to a network drive or to a floppy disk or USB stick. If you want to have a message before the files are copy to the disk, enter the following commands in the BAT file (e.g. `HEG.BAT`) behind the line “`:OUTPUT`":

```vb
ECHO MsgBox "Please insert floppy for Optimization ID " & %2, 48, "Bys cutting code driver" > TempMsgBox.vbs
wscript TempMsgBox.vbs
```

### 1.3. Configuration of cutting code driver
Each cutting table has a directory containing the drivers and corresponding configuration. This includes a script for controlling, a DL file to adopt the driver configuration, BLOCK.PTH, and further driver-dependent programs.

The BATCH script for controlling has to be the same name as the directory of the driver package. If not, it will not be found by the batch release. Please consider this, in case the directory is renamed during customer installation.

The SETUP overwrites the template directories, which can be used if you configure a new cutting table. If not exist SETUP copies the template directories to the production directory.

During machine code creation, the `OPT2SAVE` file will be unpacked and copied to the working directory. Afterwards the script for controlling will be called in production directory. In the script the driver configuration of the DL file will be written to the unpacked `OPT2TXT.DAT`. Then, the driver will be called that generates a cutting code in the working directory. At the end this cutting code will be copied to the target directory. The process will be controlled by a control script which will be installed during SETUP. Don't manipulate the control script; the files will be overwriting during SETUP.

Now it is possible to generate a cutting code. Depending on the cutting table, sometimes it is necessary to adapt the driver configuration (often in DL file). The DL file modifies the configuration of the `OPT2TXT.DAT`. This configuration file contains at least one record for each driver. A description of the `OPT2TXT.DAT` can be found here:
`\\jupiter\DOKU_DocuWare\XOPT_XOPTS\XOPTFiles\User_Manuals\Opt2txt.pdf`

**List of directories**
A+W Production and A+W Business Pro uses the same files, but in different directories. The working directory is the same.

*   **A+W Production**: → `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\...`
*   **A+W Business Pro**: → `P:\Release\...`
*   **Template directory**: → `...\Driver\AUW_Tables\`
*   **Driver directory**: → `...\Driver\`
*   **Production directory**: → `...\Tables\`
*   **Control script (AWBPro)**: → `...\Tables\CuttingDrivers.BAT`
*   **Control script (AWP)**: → `...\Tables\CUTTING2.BAS`
*   **Working directory**: → `%APPDATE%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\Tables\`

For each cutting code you have one sub directory in the `TABLES` folder. The directory name is the ID. The directory includes a control script `<ID>.BAT`, `BLOCK.PTH`, DL files, `cu_DL.BAT` (e.g. sub directory HEG includes control script `HEG.BAT`). The sub directories in the template folder will be overwrite during SETUP, in production folder not.

The control scripts execute cutting code driver in driver directory (e.g. `HEG.BAT` executes `XOPTB.EXE` and `XCEDICUT.EXE`). This driver directory will be overwriting during SETUP, too.

**cu_DL.BAT**
With this script it is possible to disable or activate DL files in each driver package. Each driver could have different settings, so you have to manipulate this `cu_DL.BAT` and the DL files, but not the control script. In each cutting code driver package you will find a `cu_DL.BAT` script and it is execute in the cutting code driver control script.

Newer driver (Albwir.Xopt....exe) don't use `OPT2TXT` for their settings, they have its own `CONFIG` file and no `cu_DL.BAT`.

### 1.4. List of cutting code driver and their characteristics
Each driver package must contain a `BLOCK.PTH`. The `BLOCK.ZIP` is used for default. Depending on the cutting table, it is necessary to adapt the DL files on site, e.g. the cutting table works in INCH. For details refer to the `OPT2TXT` description. The default package contains the following cutting code driver.

**PerfectCut**
PerfectCut is a common software from company RO which can control different cutting tables, like MACOTEC.
We have 2 drivers, one a normal driver which generates a cutting code and one which generates a list of units with their sequence and rack number. This list can be optimized by PerfectCut. For both drivers we generate DXF files for each shape. The settings for the driver are configured in a `CONFIG` file in the working directory. If the `CONFIG` file doesn't exist, the driver generates one with all possible parameter.

*   **Script:** `ROP.BAT`
    *   **Driver:** `Albwir.XOPT.RoPattern.exe` (`RoPattern.config`)
    *   **Output:** `*.IMP`
    *   Generates a normal cutting code for each pattern in one file or one file for all pattern

*   **Script:** `ROR.BAT`
    *   **Driver:** `Albwir.XOPT.RoRack.exe` (`RoRack.config`)
    *   **Output:** `*.IMP`
    *   Generates a file with all sheets, their sequence and rack information

*   **Additional Tool:** `Albwir.Xopt.ShapeToDXF.exe` (`ShapeToDxf.config`)
    *   **Output:** `*.DFX`
    *   Generate a DXF file for each shape, the name of the files can configure in the `CONFIG` file. This definition has to be configure in the config files of the driver too.

**Optima**
Optima Software can controls different cutting code tables, e.g. MACOTEC. The interface format is similar to AWCUT. Configuration will set in a `CONFIG` file in the working directory. If the file doesn't exist, the driver generates one with all possible parameter.
*   **Script:** `OPTI.BAT`
*   **Driver:** `Albwir.Xoptc.Optima.exe` (`Optima.config`)
*   **Output:** `*.OPT`

**Turomas**
*   **Directory:** `TUR`
*   **Script:** `TUR.BAT`
*   **Driver:** `Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.exe`
*   **Cutting Code:** `P<4digit JOB><3digit LOT>.R01`
*   **CONFIG:** `Turomas.config`
*   **DL File:** `118_area_del_off.DL`, `118_area_del_on.dl`
*   **XOPTC_OPTI_LOS:** 1, output only per lot possible
*   **ADDON:** `TuromasLabelProcess.exe` (see chapter for Labelprint)

In the `Turomas.config` the parameter for the cutting code file name are configure in section `<Settings>`, the cutting code file name must be max. 8 character long:
```xml
<Settings>
    <OptiBaseName>P</OptiBaseName>
    <FillJob> </FillJob>
    <DigitOptRun>3</DigitOptRun>
    <DigitJobId>4</DigitJobId>
    <SplitJobOpt></SplitJobOpt>
    <IsCod_dat>false</IsCod_dat>
    <OutputFormat>0</OutputFormat>
</Settings>
```

**INTERMAC OTD**
*   **Directory:** `IOTD`
*   **Script:** `IOTD.BAT`
*   **Driver:** `Albwir.Xoptc.IntermacOtd.exe`
*   **Cutting Code:** `P<4digit JOB>_<3digit LOT>.OTD`
*   **CONFIG:** `IntermacOtd.config`
*   **XOPTC_OPTI_LOS:** 1, output only per lot possible

In `IntermacOtd.config` the parameter for the cutting code name could be found. You can change the parameter, the script copy all OTD files with batch number in name into destination folder. The following parameter control the name of the output files:
*   `DigitsJobId` - Number of digits of the job or batch number
*   `DigitsRun` - Number of digits of the lot number
*   `SplitJobOpt` - Delimiter between job and lot number
*   `FileBaseName` - String with which the name begins

### 1.5. Cutting Code with Label Print
Since version 6.4 there exist cutting tables which can directly control a label printer during cutting. All printers need extra information for the labels, but the technology used is different. We have built features which generate additional information using Crystal Reports in A+W Business Pro and A+W Production. These reports generate PDF and/or Text files which are stored as additional information besides the OPT2 files. Cutting code drivers use these files to generate label specific output files for the cutting table.

> This feature is chargeable and is not include the price of the normal A+W cutting table connector. For a normal cutting table a customer needs an A+W connector B. To use label printing a customer needs an A+W connector C. Ask sales for more information.

To make it work an `OPT2BAR.DAT` is needed, to allow the driver to find the correct label corresponding to the barcode. So you need to generate a label for each barcode. There are 2 kinds of additional data: `LABEL.DAT` and `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF`.

Optimizations with ShapeOpt maybe not supported, because in the cutting code you often have only one record set for the both sheets optimized together with shape opt.

#### 1.5.1. LABEL.DAT
`LABEL.DAT` is a text file generated by Crystal Report `LABELDAT.RPT`. This report generates a section of data for each barcode. Each section starts with the following line which is needed to identify the section `[CuttingDataProviderSection][{Number of Machine}][{Barcode}]` and it ends with `[EOS]`.

Our drivers currently support the keyword `CuttingDataProviderSection`. New drivers or other applications in the future will possibly support other keywords.

The section contains a list of individual parameters in the following format:
`<{Name of Parameter}="{Parameter Value}">`

This format could be different for individual drivers, currently we have only one driver which uses this format.

Here is an example from A+W Business Pro:
```
[CuttingDataProviderSection][1000][T200020630001000]
<ORDERNO="20630"> <ITEMBNO="1"> <BOMID="0"> <JOB="1004">
<OPTIMIZATION="8"> <QUANTITY="5"> <SHAPENO="0">
<COMMISSION="Kommission A"> <CUSTOMERITEM="KDPos A">
<DELIVERYDATE="30.06.2017"> <BARCODE="T200020630001000">
<PRODUCTNO="104"> <PRODUCT="Float 4 mm A+W">
<CUSTOMERNO="1070"> <CUSTOMERNAME="Becker Glasbau">
<WIDTH_CUT="1.700,00"> <HEIGHT_CUT="1.800,00">
...
[EOS]
```

This file can be used for every cutting code driver, maybe in future also to send additional information to the cutting code driver. Actual (v6) it is used only for the label print feature of the BOTTERO cutting code driver.

In our standard report you find a formula `<LabelDatFormat>`. In this formula the shared number variable `LabelDatFormat` will be set. Actual values are 0 (default) and 1 (OPTIMA). If you set this to 1 the output are fields which are for OPTIMA, because this driver recommend fields with fix names. In future maybe more options will be available, but it still could be that the reports must be adjusted during the project to solve the customer's request.

#### 1.5.2. PrintCuttingLabels.PDF
In the `PrintCutting.PDF` you provide real labels, one label per page and one label for each barcode in the optimization.

Each page must have a hidden control field containing the barcode number: `@@BARCODE={Barcode}@@`
For example: `@@BARCODE=00010002@@`

The cutting code driver splits the PDF into one page for each barcode and builds a new PDF for each pattern in the correct sequence. This new PDF is sent to the cutting table along with the cutting code.

#### 1.5.3. Configuration A+W Business Pro
Configure parameter in for cutting machine settings with a comma separated list of cutting machine IDs. One Parameter for the `LABEL.DAT` `[PARAM23 / STRVALUE1]` and one Parameter for `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF` `[PARAM23 / STRVALUE2]`.

`LABEL.DAT` will be generate with Report `LABELDAT.RPT`.
`PrintCuttingLabels.PDF` generate with Report `PrintCuttingLabels.RPT`. If you need different Reports for different cutting table you can use the Report `PrintCuttingLabels<MachineID>.RPT`.

The reports must exist in the Reports directory of A+W Business. The output files will be generate direct in directory `%APPDATA%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\Tables\` and are copied in the TableID sub directory.

#### 1.5.4. Configuration A+W Production
This function are implemented in the scripts `JobRelease.VB` and `Cutting2.BAS` since version 13.4.0 (20.06.2017).

In the JobRelease configuration of the cutting table a new additional Parameter `XOPTC_LABEL` has to be added. Set the parameter name and Value in the Field Parameter. If you have more additional parameter, separate the parameter with a semicolon. The following values are possible:
*   `XOPTC_LABEL=1` – generate `LABEL.DAT` with Report `LABELDAT.RPT`
*   `XOPTC_LABEL=2` – generate `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF` with Report `PrintCuttingLabels.RPT`, if you need different Reports for different cutting table you can use the Report `PrintCuttingLabels<TableID>.RPT`.
*   `XOPTC_LABEL=3` – generate both

The Reports must exist in folder `$SERVERDIR$\Reports\Lables\`. The output files will be generate direct in directory `%APPDATA%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\Tables\<TableID>\`.

In The report for the `LABEL.DAT` use the Machine ID from `XOPT_OPTIMIERUNG.OPTIPAR`.

#### 1.5.5. Labels with Turomas
After generate the cutting code driver with `Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.exe`, execute the additional tool `TuromasLabelProcess.exe`. This tool uses the same configuration file, `Turomas.config`, and is working if `OPT2BAR` and `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF` exist beside the generated cutting code.

For each pattern in the cutting code a file `<CuttingCodeName>_<PatternNo>.POS` and `<CuttingCodeName>_<PatternNo>.PDF` will be generated. The PDF file contains the labels from `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF`.

After this the generated PDF files per pattern will be convert into a PRN file. A PRN file is the file format which is generated direct by the printer driver. In this solution the printer driver generate his output direct into a file. The generated PRN file will be renamed into `<CuttingCodeName>_<PatternNo>.PRN` and is part of the package of cutting code and `.POS` files. The PDF file isn't need anymore and the files will be removed if the conversion was done fine.

The conversion into PRN file is not so easy, you need some tools and some configurations:

**Windows printer driver**
Turomas uses CAB Printer (https://www.cab.de), e.g. Model Hermes+ 4L/300. Download the right printer driver and install it on the Server where you generate cutting code. Configure the printer driver, generate a label format with the size of the used label and set this format as default, maybe it is need to set this as default for each windows user.
The Crystal Report `PrintCuttingLabels.RPT` has also to be generated and stored with this printer driver and the same label layouts you use on the server during cutting code generation. The same technic we use if we generate normal labels with Crystal Reports.
The name of the printer has to be configured in `Turomas.config` parameter `<Printer>`.
`<Printer>CAB Hermes+ 4L/300</Printer>`

**PDF Reader**
We support ADOBE or FOXIT. One of the reader must be installed and which one is used has to be configured in `Turomas.config` in parameter `<ReaderType>`: 1 = ADOBE, 2 = FOXIT. Our driver open the PDF in the reader and print them on the configured printer. The driver also close the PDF reader if the PRN file was generate. This can take a while so you have to configure some timeouts in milliseconds if nothing happens in the parameter `<WaitForPdfReader>` and `<WaitOpenFile>`.
```xml
<ReaderType>1</ReaderType>
<WaitForPdfReader>10000</WaitForPdfReader>
<WaitOpenFile>2000</WaitOpenFile>
```

**Multi File Port Monitor**
The freeware tool Multi File Port Monitor is need (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mfilemon/). The tool can be find in the AUW Turomas package in sub directory tools (`.\Release\Driver\AUW_Tables\TUR\Tools\`), or download it.

Install the tool and configure a printer port for the Windows printer driver and set the output in the driver fix to this port. If you do this, the driver doesn't print on a physical printer, it print the result into a file. We can't use the Windows standard printer port `FILE`, because in this function you have to enter an output filename every time you print and with the Multi File Port Monitor you can configure the filename.

In **Devices and Printers** mark a printer and open in the **Printer server properties** the tab **Ports** and **Change Port Settings**. Add a new Port from type `Multi File Port Monitor`. We recommend as port name `PRNFILES`.

The path must be fixed, UNC path possible but variables (e.g. `%APPDATA%`) doesn't work. The user need reading and writing rights on this path.

For the Filename use the following pattern: `PrintCuttingLabels.%u.%c.prn`. This generate a file with user name and computer name. So it is possible to generate this cutting code on one Server from different users.

In the next step allocate the new port to the Turomas printer. Open the **Printer Properties** and in tab **Ports** select the new port `PRNFILES`.

For testing the configuration open a PDF document in your PDF reader and print the document on this printer. After this the PRN file should be generated in the configured output directory.

You must configure the same output path and file pattern in the `Turomas.config` in parameter `<TempPrinterFile>` as configured in Multi File Port Monitor. The placeholder `%u` and `%c` works in both file pattern.
`<TempPrinterFile>C:\Temp\PrintCuttingLabels.%u.%c.prn</TempPrinterFile>`

**Turomas.config**
In the `Turomas.config` the parameter for the label print function are configure in section `<Label>`. Here an Example:
```xml
<Label>
    <WaitForPdfReader>10000</WaitForPdfReader>
    <WaitOpenFile>2000</WaitOpenFile>
    <ReaderType>1</ReaderType>
    <Printer>CAB Hermes+ 4L/300</Printer>
    <TempPrinterFile>C:\Temp\PrintCuttingLabels.%u.%c.prn</TempPrinterFile>
</Label>
```

#### 1.5.6. Labels with BOTTERO
BOTTERO generates and print the Labels with its own applications, but they need several information for the sheets in the cutting code to print them on the label. The information we prepare in the `LABEL.DAT`.
The driver `BotLabelProcess.exe` must be execute before `XCBOTHPS.EXE` and it search in `LABEL.DAT` for packages with the following syntax:
```
[CuttingDataProviderSection][{Maschin ID}][{Barcode Number}]
<{Name of Parameter}="{Parameter Value}">
...
[EOS]
```
The Output is the file `BotLabel.TXT`. The cutting code driver `XCBOTHPS.EXE` uses this file if exist and add the information into the cutting code. The complete text between the header line and `[EOS]` will be used and convert into one line. Special character like line/page break will be removed. You need `XCBOTHPS.EXE` version 1.81 or higher.

#### 1.5.7. Labels with HEGLA
HEGLA need a PDF file for each label with the name `<BarcodeNumber>.PDF`. The tool `Albwir.Xopt.HeglaLabel.EXE` will split `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF` into different PDF files for all barcode numbers which are found in the optimization. This tool must be execute before “XOPTB -e" (min. `XOPTB` version 6.87) and will be configured in `HeglaLabel.config`.

An `OPT2BAR` is necessary and the following `OPT2TXT` parameter must be set to make it work:
`[45:26] = 1`
`[98:17-20] > 0000`

The cutting code driver stores the label number of the sheets in Parameter `ISheetId` in `T` records. Actual this function doesn't work for sheets nested with ShapeOpt.

**HeglaLabel.config**
The PDF files will be stored in the Parameter `PdfPath`. The Parameter can be an environment variable which can be set in the `HEG.BAT` with the SET command before `Albwir.Xopt.HeglaLabel.EXE` will be execute.

With the Parameter `MinSheetSerialMode` you can set the quantity when a line item will count as series. For a series only one PDF for the first sheet and one for the last sheet will be generate.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<HeglaSettings xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <PdfPath>%HeglaPDFPath%</PdfPath>
    <SplitPdf>true</SplitPdf>
    <EmptyLabelInfo>1</EmptyLabelInfo>
    <MinSheetSerialMode>9999</MinSheetSerialMode>
    <RectangleMode>2</RectangleMode>
</HeglaSettings>
```

#### 1.5.8. Labels with OPTIMA
OPTIMA generates and print the Labels with its own applications, but they need several information for the sheets in the cutting code to print them on the label. The information we prepare in the `LABEL.DAT`.

The driver `Albwir.XOPTC.Optima.exe` search for in `LABEL.DAT` and if exist it uses special Fields which are allowed in the `INFO` section of the OPTIMA Cutting code driver. Not all allowed Fields are supported by our cutting code driver. So if OPTIMA extend their interface it is need to extend our cutting code driver and the `LABELDAT.RPT` report. The `LABEL.DAT` has the following format:
`[CuttingDataProviderSection][{Maschin ID}][{Barcode Number}]`
`<{Name of Parameter}="{Parameter Value}">`
`...`
`[EOS]`

The following fields of the interface will be ignored by the cutting code driver, if they exist in `LABEL.DAT`. These fields will be filled direct by cutting code driver: `Id`, `SheetWidth`, `SheetHeigth`, `RackNo`.

Following a few example fields which are supported by cutting code driver:
```
[CuttingDataProviderSection][TB1][00010000]
<SecondGlassReference="1">
<Customer="Customer0">
<PosNo="1">
<OrderNo="513654">
<RackCode="201">
<RealDimXPz="5200">
<RealDimYPz="2528">
<DescMatCompPz="Novellini">
<DeliveryDatePz="17-10-2017">
<PzNOTE="Job 0815">
<PzNOTE1="OPTIMIZATION 9">
<PzNOTE3="BARCODE 00010000">
[EOS]
```
This looks like that in the cutting code:
```
[Info]
Id=1
RackNo=288
SheetWidth=1473.200
SheetHeight=800.100
SecondGlassReference=88
Customer=Customer22
PosNo=23
OrderNo=513654
RealDimXPz=4032
RealDimYPz=7424
DescMatCompPz=Novellini
PzNote=Job 0815
PzNote1=OPTIMIZATION 9
PzNote3=BARCODE 00010087
```

List of supported Parameters. If they exist in `LABEL.DAT` they will transferred into the `INFO` field of cutting code:
`SecondGlassReference`, `Customer`, `PosNo`, `OrderNo`, `PieceStandardPz`, `RealDimXPz`, `RealDimYPz`, `GrindingPz`, `GrindingPzX1`, `GrindingPzY1`, `GrindingPzX2`, `GrindingPzY2`, `BendingPz`, `QuantityPz`, `PriorityPz`, `LabelsPz`, `LabelsPzCounter`, `RotationAllowed`, `PreferencePz`, `DescMatCompPz`, `DeliveryDatePz`, `PzNote`, `PzNote1`, `PzNote2`, `PzNote3`, `PzNote4`, `PzNote5`, `PzNote6`, `PzNote7`, `PzNote8`, `PzNote9`, `PzNote10`, `PzNote11`, `PzNote12`, `PzNote13`, `PzNote14`, `PzNote15`, `PzNote16`, `PzNote17`, `PzNote18`, `PzNote19`, `PzNote20`

#### 1.5.9. Labels with INTERMAC OTD
The INTERMAC cutting code driver `Albwir.Xoptc.IntermacOtd.exe` automatic search for `PrintCuttingLabels.PDF`. If file exist, the PDF will be renamed into the same name like the cutting code OTD file. The renamed PDF and a XML file with same name will be copied into an existing folder which is configured in `IntermacOtd.config` parameter `<LabelPath>`.

The label printing our special application `IntermacPrintDaemon` will handle. This tool will monitor the cutting process of the INTERMAC cutting table and send the right label file to the label printer.

The interface of INTERMAC is described here:
`\\jupiter\Doku_DocuWare\Technology_Partner\Intermac\Product_OTD_Specification\LabelPrinterOnGeniusCT_Rev00.pdf`

In a released folder the cutting table generate a file called `ToPrint.TXT`. `IntermacPrintDaemon` monitor this folder and read this file. In this file information about actual cut sheet can be found and the `IntermacPrintDaemon` search in the PDF and XML files for the right label. Temporary the PDF file of the lot is split into a bitmap file for each label. The bitmap file will be send to the printer and the `ToPrint.TXT` will be deleted.

The `IntermacPrintDaemon` requires Ghostscript driver to handle the PDF files. Download and install GPL Ghostscript on the PC where `IntermacPrintDaemon` will be execute: https://www.ghostscript.com/download/

**Attention:** If you have a 64-Bit Operation System you need the 64-Bit Ghostscript driver. The 32-Bit driver works, but doesn't create an output.

Configure `IntermacPrintDaemon` with this configuration file `PrintDaemon.config`.

**PrintDaemon.config**
The `PrintDaemon.config` has the same configuration parameter like `IntermacOtd.config` to identify the file names of OTD, XML and PDF files. The parameter in both configuration files must be equal.
*   `DigitsJobId` - Number of digits of the job or batch number
*   `DigitsRun` - Number of digits of the lot number
*   `FillJob` - Fill character if job number is shorter
*   `SplitJobOpt` - Delimiter between job and lot number
*   `FileBaseName` - String with which the name begins

The parameter for the folder:
*   `OptiPath` - Folder where XML and PDF files are stored; same path like parameter `LabelPath` in `IntermacOtd.config`
*   `ToPrintPath` - Folder where INTERMAC store `ToPrint.txt`
*   `PdfConverterPath` - Folder where `PDFConvert.exe` is stored
*   `BitmapBase` - local directory where `IntermacPrintDaemon` stores bitmap files

Parameter to adjust the bitmap on a label for printing:
*   `PrinterName` – Name of printer where labels should be print
*   `OffsetLabelX` - X coordinate of the bitmap on the label
*   `OffsetLabelY` - Y coordinate of the bitmap on the label
*   `DpiX` - Resolution in X direction for converting PDF into bitmap
*   `DpiY` - Resolution in Y direction for converting PDF into bitmap
*   `UseCrop` - Use section from PDF (actual set on true)
    First a bitmap of total page with defined resolution is created.
    The following section is defined in pixels of the intermediate image.
    *   `CropLeft` - Left edge of the section
    *   `CropTop` - Top edge of the section
    *   `CropRight` - Right edge of the section
    *   `CropBottom` - Bottom edge of the section

**Printer**
Information about the printer by INTERMAC:
*   Printer is Toshiba B-EX4T2
*   The printer is connected by network cable in Genius CT (in HUB or D-LINK ethernet port). It is placed in Intermac private network. Printer requires static IP address. Genius CT will be configurated for costumer network with static IP address too.
*   If labeling section was written in OTD files, Genius CT wait for print the label. It is not possible to cancel or avoid a single label. Anyway it is possible to avoid the labelling process by a button enable/disable placed in Genius CT interface.

### 1.6. Laser marking
What is laser marking? During the cutting process a laser burns a logo on the sheet. The position of the logo is defined in the cutting code.
In the BOM the logo is defined in a processing of standard A+W processing type 1255. In A+W Production, the processing has to be attached at the cutting part and contains information about position, rotation angle or logo id.

#### 1.6.1. Variant without SN file
You activate this variant with `OPT2TXT` parameter `[45:24]`. This only applies for rectangles and is supported by EDICUT cutting code interface. A record in the `BLOCK` file isn't necessary.

A+W Realtime Optimizer is necessarily required. Before generating the cutting code the logo information will be stored in the `OPT2DAT` (`CHRHOST` filed, `LABEL.SET`) if they are not filled (detailed scheduling doesn't fill the fields).

The processing with the laser marking information has to be allocated in machinery allocation to the cutting table. If not, the A+W Realtime Optimizer doesn't write the information into `OPT2` file.

**Configuration XOPTON.CFG:**
```ini
[Laser]
Mode=1
AdditionalTextMode=0
```

**Configuration OPT2TXT:**
`[45:24] = 1` → for “`XOPTB -e`" to generate the info records
`[45:24] = 2` → for mirrored coordinates

**Configuration LABEL.SET:**
The following fields has to be defined in `LABEL.SET` for laser marking.

| Field | Length | Description | Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CUTMIRROR` | 1 | `FEIN_UNIT.CUTMIRROR` | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_LAYER` | 1 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS1` | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_IDENT` | 8 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS2` (Logo ID) | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_CORNER` | 1 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS3` | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_XPOS` | 5 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS4` (X - position of the mark) | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_YPOS` | 5 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS5` (Y - position of the mark) | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_WIDTH` | 5 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS6` | No |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_HEIGHT` | 5 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS7` | No |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_REFPOINT` | 1 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS10` | No |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_REFEDGE` | 2 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS11` | No |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_ANGLE` | 3 | `POOL_BEARBEIT.MASS12` (rotation angle 0-360) | Yes |
| `AWTYPE_LOGO_DATA` | 24 | ? | Yes |

#### 1.6.2. Variant with SN file
This variant is activated via the `OPT2TXT` switch `[45:25]` and available since release version 5.4. It also applies to shapes and is currently supported by the EDICUT cutting code.

**Requirement:**
*   `BLOCK` Entry of the sheet (thus also an SN drawing is required) which is also used during optimization.
*   A+W Realtime Optimizer for cutting code output (`OPT2BAR` is absolutely necessary to accurately identify individual sheets).

**Configuration SN.INI:**
In the machine section (`[ALCIM2000]`, import in A + W Production), the switch `ExportSurfaceProcessing = 1` must be set to activate the LOGO export.

**Configuration A+W Production:**
To optimize the sheets (rectangles and standard models) with SN drawing, and use the `BLOCK` entry during optimization, disable parameter `[ALCIM_SHAPE / SNCUTASSTANDARDFRM]`.

If you use this variant you lose the possibility of other A+W Production features, which doesn't work with `BLOCK` entry for standard shapes and rectangle: Extended edge deletion, Shape optimization.

**EDICUT Cutting Code:**
The laser marking is transferred in the info fields of the EDICUT code, `XOPTB -E` must be called and the EDICUT code must be set to read the `EDICUT.TMP`.
*   Call `LaserMarkWriter.exe` (currently without parameters, will be improved if the details of the machine are known). The program reads `OPT2DAT` and `BLOCK` and extracts the data from the laser marking. The program creates a file `LaserMark.TXT`. Previously, the old file should be deleted.
*   `XOPTB` reads the file `LaserMark.TXT` (if the laser marking is activated) and fills the corresponding info data in the `EDICUT.TMP`.
*   `XCEDICUT` reads the `EDICUT.TMP` and creates the code.

**Data record for laser marking:**
The data set is accommodated in the T information of each sheet. The structure is as follows:
`IMarkierungNNNXXXX.XXXYYYY.YYYLLLLLLLLWWWWTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT`
Example: `IMarkierung0010030.0000373.00000000001000033.1F`
*   Identification ("Markierung")
*   3 digits for Identification number (Datatyp: Integer)
*   8 digits for the X-Position of the marking (e.g.: 1234.567 mm)
*   8 digits fort he Y-Position of the marking (e.g.: 1234.567 mm)
*   8 digits for the logoID (Datentyp: Integer)
*   4 digits for the angle of rotation (0-360)
*   24 digits User data (Zahlen 0...9, Buchstaben)

### 1.7. Troubleshooting
In case of problems with generated machine code the generated code, the `OPT2SAVE` file of the corresponding optimization, and the driver directory are necessary for investigation. Error messages of the driver appear in a DOS Prompt during call.

#### 1.7.1. Circle troubles on INTERMAC (XCAWCUT)
It could happen, that an INTERMAC cutting table with `XCAWCUT` cutting driver cuts a full circle three times.
The reason is, INTERMAC has a problem with the 4 quarter circle. We transfer them as 4 quarter circle in clockwise (CW) orientation, but INTERMAC produced them as counter clockwise (CCW) orientation.
If you set the `OPT2TXT` parameter `[106:22] = 1`, the problem will be solved. With this we transfer the data with counter clockwise (CCW) orientation.

## 2. Cutting Table via A+W Realtime Optimizer and CutTV
One of the first things to do for any technician going out on an A+W Realtime Optimizer install is to prepare in advance for his upcoming visit. This starts for me by getting in touch with the responsible sales person from our end to make sure all modules etc. have been included from the A+W side. Furthermore it is also very important to get in touch with the customer to make sure everything required for our software to communicate properly with cutting table is in place. In case we are missing modules from the cutting table manufacturer's end he will have to get in touch with them.

Some of the key questions to be asked will depend on the type of cutting table of course - I will try to address these in each of the upcoming chapters.

If uncertain about specific configurations, etc. I always like to go back to my previous installs of the cutting table in question to review what has been done in the past.

Please also note that the setup for controlling cutting tables is pretty much identical for both A+W Realtime Optimizer and CutTV (`CUTTV.CFG` vs. `XOPTON.CFG`).

### 2.1. BYSTRONIC
BYSTRONIC is probably one of the most common cutting tables out there. One of the key things to look at prior to the install is the type of cutting table. From the 1980's up until about 1992, 1993 Bystronic tables used to be controlled via a serial connection.

After that till now they use their MMC software which is running the **DNC Net online protocol** that allows us a "pattern by pattern" control of the table.

**BYSTRONIC 84/89/92**
In order to control the table you need to create your own cable. There is a configuration for it on the "Glasstree". On the Bystronic side there are usually two “SERCOM” boards – which you can access to the back of the Bystronic Control Panel. These SERCOM boards will have switches and radio buttons to set Baudrate etc. which have to match the settings you have in your `XOPTON.CFG` file (sample settings below). In regards to these settings there is no rule of thumb - I had to adjust these for each table. Please also note that you have to be very careful when putting them back into the panel since they a) break easily and b) have to be pushed hard back into the slot.

These Sercom boards are also one of them main trouble makers - they tend to break every couple of years and if you seem to not getting any connection established it is always worth switching them.

Beside the `XOPTON.CFG` and Bystronic Sercom board settings also make sure you configure your Serial port properly on your PC. You can actually test the connection through Hyper Terminal to see if the communication works at all.

Please also note that these old tables need the “old” header record since in the cutting code – you will find more info about that in the individual cutting code documentation.

```ini

```

**BYSTRONIC 92-2012**
Following a decade of serial controlled cutting tables Bystronic switched to new operating software called MMC which included the **DNC Net online control protocol**.

As suppose to the old tables these machines run a Windows operating system (either Windows NT or Window XP) that will allow you to control them over the network. Please note though that Bystronic doesn't like it if you change the Ip Address of their machine – they have their own little network that relies on their current IP address.

That's why you either add a second network card to your own XOPTON-CutTV PC or you add another network card if possible to the Bystronic machine which with using Terminal Server these days will be the better option.

The Bystronic software has one main configuration file called `mmc.ini` which is located under `c:\windows` on the Bystronic PC. In there you want to turn on the DNC Net protocol (`DNCNET=1`) and you also want to configure the working directory. There is no specific directory that needs to be used - you can create a new one or simply share the existing one (`C:\data`) for example.

Now on the XOPT-ON side you will have to obviously have to create a map drive to the Bystronic PC - then you have to configure the “Cutting" section in the `XOPTON.CFG`. Please note that the `ParamDir` directory reflects the path on the Bystronic machine so don't use the map drive!

This `Param` Directory contains the parameter files for each glass type (cutting pressure, speed etc.). If not existing you can usually create copies of existing ones and then just rename them.

The file name is based on the ALCIM article code field entry – for example your article has `00000006` in there for 6mm Clear glass the program will for a `00000006.par` file in the respective folder on the Bystronic PC.

The main communication between XOPT-ON and the Bystronic PC is done via the `status.net` and `job.net` files so you should make sure that you have read & write rights to these files.

### 2.2. LISEC
Similar to BYSTRONIC LISEC also started off with tables being controlled with a serial cable. As far as I know there is no one left of those so I will focus on the new generation tables that are also controlled via online protocol.

With Lisec it is very important to get in touch with the customer before the technician takes off for his visit. In order for the "GPS-Hand”(Lisec table software) the customer has to make sure he has the following Lisec Modules:
a) Lisec File converter
b) Remote read module

The Lisec file converter is a must - without that the software can't read the A+W code.
The Remote read module is necessary for the pattern by pattern communication but is not mandatory!

This should be setup by a Lisec technician - I know it is a locked option and also needs to be enabled in GPS-Hand. A map drive to wherever they would like to receive their cutting codes will also be necessary. The online protocol is actually one of the best out there since Lisec is feeding back detailed error messages as to what is not correct. Further below I have added in a diagram that explains the way the protocol works – the `Transfer.*` files will be created in the `NCprogdir`.

On the Lisec side the customer needs to setup “recipes” for the individual Glass Types – the recipe # comes from our article code field. If nothing is in there it will use 0 as a default.

Please note for tables capable of running both regular glass and Lami glass the recipe number for Laminated glass has to be >= 101.

```ini

**Lisec Protocol Communications diagram**
1.  **At Startup:** A+W deletes `DATA.REQ`, `DATA.OK`, Data record, and `TRANSFER.*` files.
2.  **A+W checks:**
    *   If `TRANSFER.RUN` exists: Display "laser processing data" message and wait.
    *   If `TRANSFER.ERR` exists: Display "communication error: <content of TRANSFER.ERR>" message, then delete `TRANSFER.ERR` and `DATA.OK`.
    *   If `DATA.OK` exists: Display "waiting for laser to read data" message and wait.
3.  **A+W sends data:**
    *   Copy data record to the transfer directory.
    *   Create `DATA.OK`.
4.  **Lisec receives data:**
    *   Waits for `DATA.OK`.
    *   Deletes `DATA.OK`.
    *   Creates `TRANSFER.RUN`.
    *   Reads the data record and transmits it to the laser.
5.  **Lisec responds:**
    *   **If successful:** Deletes the data record and `TRANSFER.RUN`, then creates `TRANSFER.OK`.
    *   **If error:** Deletes `TRANSFER.RUN`, then creates `TRANSFER.ERR` with error details.
6.  **A+W finalizes:**
    *   A+W deletes the data record, `TRANSFER.OK`, and `DATA.OK` to complete the cycle.

### 2.3. HEGLA
HEGLA is probably the most common cutting table in Europe but also has become a household name in a lot of North American plants. The HEGLA table has always been controlled over the network but it has just been since the late 1990`s that they are using the latest HEGLA program OPTIMAX that allows online control (pattern by pattern control).

The setup is simple – XOPTON will simply create the cutting code into a shared directory (the one that you agree with the HEGLA technician on). From there HEGLA will pick up the file and communicate with XOPT-ON through the `Dummy.edi` log file located within the shared folder.

One of the biggest issues that will come with HEGLA table is the limitation of the HEGLA software only excepting only 5 digit article numbers. That means that if your article number is greater than that it will be cut off after five digits automatically from the cutting code driver. In case you have several tables you can use the ALCIM-tables-Articles function to work around the issue or in case you just have a HEGLA table you will have the article code field to translate article numbers into shorter numbers.

HEGLA also has a Remaster module the documentation for that will be dealt with in a separate document.
```ini
; Section for cutting
[Cutting]
MzoTableId=1
Table=HEG1
inittable=TABLE=HEGLA;DESTINATION=S:\AW\DATA.EDI;LOGFILE=DUMMY.EDI
CuttingCodeName=HEGLA(P).EDI
```

### 2.4. BOTTERO
BOTTERO is also one of the more common cutting tables globally and they have improved their communication significantly with their latest generation table and their revised software.

Up until about 2006 there was no direct online control possible – the BOTTERO software was running in a dos environment. Getting these machines into a network environment used to be very tricky and time consuming. That's why in a lot of cases the old floppy drive was the main source of transferring the cutting codes. The BOTTERO also has the specialty that the cutting code is written in a hexadecimal format. It also requires the shape information to be created into a separate file so you will see two file for the run in question.

For the old tables that meant that you created your cutting codes then had the table read in the file - in case there were recuts that went onto the last sheet or that required additional sheets XOPTON will recreate the cutting code and the code will need to be read in by the BOTTERO software again.

For the new generation tables since 2006 there is new BOTTERO table software which runs under the new generation Windows operating systems that will allow a single pattern transfer communication in between XOPTON and the cutting table. Similar to the HEGLA table the `XT_RCUTF32.EXE` is used to create the individual files per sheet.
```ini
; Section for cutting
[Cutting]
;UseMZO=Y
Table=BOT2
inittable=TABLE=BOTTERO;DESTINATION=0:\cutcodes\BOT2\CUTCODE.OPT;LOGFILE=dummy.log
CuttingCodeName=cutcodes\bot(P).dat
```

### 2.5. BILLCO
BILLCO is an American cutting table manufacturer. The interface hasn't really changed in a long time - since there is no online connection to the table will be controlled simply by creating the cutting code into the share folder of the BILLCO PC.

The cutting codes consist of two files `Batch.*` and `scores.*`.
```ini
; Section for cutting
[Cutting]
MzoTableId=1
Table=Bill
inittable=TABLE=DUMMY
```

### 2.6. TUROMAS

#### 2.6.1. Initial settings (AUW_Configuration_cutting.docx)
After the RTO is installed, we have to install the following software following the description at the point 6.5 of the document "AUW_Configuration_cutting.docx":
1.  Windows printer driver
2.  PDF Reader (ADOBE)
3.  Multi File Port Monitor

#### 2.6.2. RTO label
The RTO label has only 2 parameter fields: "schedule" and "los".
The label has to contain the variable: `@@BARCODE={Barcode}@@`

Example: `'@@BARCODE=' +CStr({fein_unit.etikettnr}) +'@@'` → `@@BARCODE=00010002@@`

This variable has to be printed and hidden (using white color) for each label.

#### 2.6.3. Installation and settings for PDF24 application
We have to install the virtual printer "PDF24" and rename it to “TuromasPDF".
To install this printer we use the “pdf24-creator-8.4.1.exe".
We need to do the following settings at the PDF24 application:

*   **Wizard (Asistente)**
    *   Uncheck `Cerrar el Asistente después de guardar el archivo` (Close Assistant after saving the file)
    *   Uncheck `Cerrar el Asistente tras enviar email del archivo` (Close Assistant after sending the file by email)
    *   Check `Abrir el archivo PDF después de guardarlo` (Open the PDF file after saving)
*   **Virtual printer PDF24 (TuromasPDF)**
    *   **Automatic save (Guardado automático)**
        *   `Directorio de destino`: `%APPDATA%\A+W\Techsoft\Xopton\Cutting`
        *   `Nombre del archivo`: `PrintCuttingLabels`
        *   `Calidad`: `Calidad Superior` (Superior Quality)
*   **Context of the Interfase menu (Contexto del Menú del Interfaz)**
    *   Uncheck `Ampliar el archivo y el directorio del contexto del menú del interfaz con útiles funciones`
*   **Online PDF Converter**
    *   Uncheck `Utilizar el convertidor PDF24 online como método de respaldo`

#### 2.6.4. Configuration of “Iblprinting.bas"
At the "Iblprinting.bas" we need to inform that "TuromasPDF" will be the printer in use. By doing this setting, the printing will be performed always at the folder `%appdata%\A+W\Techsoft\Xopton\Cutting` using as name "PrintCuttingLabels".

#### 2.6.5. Configuration of cutting.bat
At the "cutting.bat", we have to do the following actions:
1.  Clean the existing files (PRN, POS, PDF) before starting the process
2.  Execute the cutting code generation
3.  Start a second Batch "Postcut.bat"

```bat
REM IF NOT EXIST XOPTB.EXE GOTO ERROR
REM IF NOT EXIST XT_RCUTF32.EXE GOTO ERROR
if exist Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.log del /f /q Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.log
XOPTB -e

Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.exe >> "Albwir.Xoptc.Turomas.log"

start /MIN Postcut.bat
cd..
GOTO ENDE
```

#### 2.6.6. Settings for "Turomas.config": Field Digit job ID
At the "Turomas.config", we have used 4 digits for the field "DigitJobId":
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TuromasParameter xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

    </Label>
</TuromasParameter>
```

#### 2.6.7. New Batch “PostCut.bat"
We have to use the new "PostCut.Bat" that will be executed in the background during the "cutting.bat". The RTO will start printing the labels creating the PDF file at the “cutting” folder.

```bat

:ERROR2
echo PrintCuttingLabels.pdf has not been generated by XOPT label printing.
```
1.  At this Batch we initialize the "Labelfolder" variable, it will be here where the files needed for Turomas are saved: Cutting code (`*.R01`) and Printing labels (POS, PRN).
2.  This Batch will wait to finish the PDF printing of the RTO by 2 options:
    a. Based on the size of the PDF file
    b. Loop up to 50 seconds (we can modify this value based on the amount of labels to print or depending on the printing speed). If after 50 seconds, there is not PDF file, then it will be redirected to the section "ERROR2".
3.  Once the PDF file has been created, the `TuromasLabelProcess.exe` will be executed to create 1 pdf file per pattern.
4.  The turomas printing files "POS" and "PRN" will be generated with the calling to the HERMES virtual printer *** this has to be the default printer ***.
5.  The last step it is to copy the files to path, but it is not necessary to remove the files.

## 3. Bender and Sealer
This chapter describes how to implement a bender and sealer driver package in an A+W Production and A+W Business Pro environment. Requirement is the base database from MarketSolutions. For other databases, the document may differ.

### 3.1. Configure bender and sealer in A+W Production
Defining a new machine is made in the machinery allocation (MZO). Important is that the **Component-ID** cannot be adjusted later. This ID creates a new data record to be found in **[Master Data / Machinery / IG Lines or Spacer Bender]**. The new machine ID must not exist in the machinery allocation.

The configuration can be made via MZO. Below, you will find the description via ALCIM Machine Dialog. You will find the component IDs to be used in the following description.

In case of questions how to configure a machine in the machinery allocation, please read the documentation regarding machinery allocation.

**ID for IG line and bender**
The unique ID has to be named consecutively `LIN1` ... `LINn` for of each IG and `BEN1` ... `BENn` for each bender. `LINM` and `BENM` is reserved for the manual line and bender.

**Allocate machine driver**
Each sealer and bender is allocated to a machine driver format and a section. Please note, that a section can only be selected once for each driver. If you use the identical driver for IG line and spacer bender, the section must be unique, too.
E.g. If LISEC IG line section 0 exists, no LISEC spacer bender may use section 0.

The machine code and section selected here refer to the configuration file `XL_JobRelease.CFG`.

**Overview ID MZO, machine and registration point**

| MZO - ID | Machine ID | Registration point | Release Dialog | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1610 | LIN1 | 1610 | BENDER_SEALER2 | IG Line 1 |
| 1620 | LIN2 | 1620 | BENDER_SEALER4 | IG Line 2 |
| 1690 | LINM | 1690 | | Manual Line |
| 1710 | BEN1 | 1710 | BENDER_SEALER1 | Bender 1 |
| 1720 | BEN2 | 1720 | BENDER_SEALER3 | Bender 2 |
| 1790 | BENM | 1790 | | Manual Bender |
| 0 | | | BENDER_SEALER8 | LISEC KSR |
| 0 | | | BENDER_SEALER9 | LISEC LineServer |

### 3.1.1. Integrate bender/sealer into Release
Location: **[Configuration / ALCIM / Release Dialog / Bender and sealer]**

A `BENDER_SEALER` action has to be defined for each machine that should create a machine code. The actions are numbered consecutively while they are added and have to be allocated afterwards to a respective button in the release dialog.

**The Most Important Switches**
*   **Lot type**
    Lot type of detailed scheduling: `700` = ISO / `1200` = Spacer bender
*   **Machine ID**
    MZO ID of machine:
    *   1610, 1620, 1630... = IG Line / 1690 = Manual Line
    *   1710, 1720, 1730... = Spacer Bender / 1790 = Manual Bender
*   **Output path**
    Path to save the machine code. For output on disc a message appears to insert the disc. Per default the output is to network in `$SERVERDIR$\PROD\`

**Machine code output for all machines**
It is possible to process all machines of a lot type with one configuration instead of using configurations for each machine. Therefore the switch **Machine ID** has to set to `0`. In the past a special script `$SERVERDIR$\SCRIPTS\JobRelease_AllForType.VB` was need, but actual this will work with the standard script `$SERVERDIR$\SCRIPTS\JobRelease.VB`.

*   **Pro:**
    In Dialog Release you need just one button for IG line and one for spacer bender.
*   **Contra:**
    The machine code of all IG lines or spacer benders will be saved to one directory. This can be adjusted by changing the `PostCreationScript` for the machines via `XL_JobRelease.CFG`. This is beyond the standard.

### 3.1.2. Configure bender texts
Bender texts are managed per item in table `POOL_TXT` for the header part.
`POOL_TXT.TEXT_TYP = 1000`
→ Bender text of order entry transferred to ALCIM

`POOL_TXT.TEXT_TYP = 1001`
→ Bender text created at batch release via `ALCIMJobRelease.DLL` and `LABELPRINT.DLL`

The switch **[ALCIM_JOB RELEASE / BENDER TEXT TYPE]** (Parameter → ALCIM → General → Job Release → Bender Text Type) controls which bender text shall be written to the machine code.

**Configuration of bender text at batch release**
If the bender text is not transferred from order entry, the release can create an individual bender text for each item. Therefore, enable function Bender Text Initialization at release.

The layout of the bender text is defined in configuration file `$SERVERDIR$\COMMON\LABELPRINT.INI`:
```ini
[BenderText]
Text0= <AufNr>/<PosNr> <Lauf> <Breite>*<Hoehe> <SZR1>/<SZR2> <ArtBez>
```
The text can consist of fixed text blocks and variables. The variables (e.g. `<AufNr>` for the order number) are defined in the configuration file in section `[BeginVar] ... [EndVar]`.

The bender texts created at release are saved in database table `POOL_TXT` with `TEXT_TYP 1001`.

**Configure various bender texts at batch release**
ALCIM includes just one bender text layout for all IGs: **[Master Date / Labels, Sketches, Bender texts / Configuration Bender Texts]**

If various bender texts are necessary, define here several layouts. It is possible to define a shape file (e.g. `Bendertext_Mueller.txt`) in the configuration of the bender text layout. This file has to be saved in the form directory and contains the definition of bender text (only the definition!) usually to be found in `LABELPRINT.INI` under `[BenderText]Text0`.

The form directory is fixed in `$SERVERDIR$\Formulars\`. There is a switch not used any longer in the `LABELPRINT.INI` to set the directory, this one should be disabled: `[Options]FormularPath`.

**Show production number in bender text**
Often it is necessary to show the production number in bender texts. Therefore, the bender code must be shown per unit and not per item (`XL_JobRelease.CFG` switch `SplitItemToUnits=Y`). The following variable in bender text can be used in `LABELPRINT.INI`:
`<ProdNr_Bieger>=FEIN_UNIT.SEQUENZTYP(T=8)`

`POOL_TXT` shows in bender text the text „`FEIN_UNIT.SEQUENZTYP`“, it will be converted to the corresponding value while creating the bender code.

### 3.2. Configure bender/sealer in A+W Business Pro
Bender and sealer are configured at the machine in A+W Business Capacity planning **[Capacity planning → Master Data → Organisation → Machines]**

In the dialog you have a type for bender and one for sealer, both works similar. You set an output directory, were machine code will be stored and you select a machine code kind.

Machine codes with a number smaller than 1000 are standard machines and can't be changed. If you generated a new machine, the new machine will be copied of the selected one and gets a new free number greater than 999.

The IG driver and IG section parameter is important. This is the direct link to the configuration file `XT_AWISO.CFG`.

**IGU:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM [SYSADM].[PROD_MACHINECODE] WHERE [MACHINETYPE] = 2 ORDER BY [MACHINECODE];
```

**Bender:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM [SYSADM].[PROD_MACHINECODE] WHERE [MACHINETYPE] = 3 ORDER BY [MACHINECODE];
```

### 3.3. Configuration of bender and sealer driver
The machine driver and section definition is listed in the configuration (CFG) file. The CFG contains an area for each machine, structured as follows: `[XL_ISO_<Treiber>_<Sektion>]` e.g. `[XL_ISO_LISEC_0]`.

Various switches can be set for each machine. A detailed description of these switches can be found in the following document:
`\\jupiter\DOKU_DocuWare\ALCIM2000\Freigabe\Installation_Configuration\File_Description_XL_CLASS.CFG_E.pdf`

The base configuration file `AUW_XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` and `AUW_XT_AWISO.CFG` contains a functional area for each driver of section 0. Specialties are shown in the CFG description. These files are a reference for the used configuration files and will be overwrite during SETUP. The belonging `PostCreationScript POSTIGU2.BAS` as well as directories of former drivers are also included in the standard.

*   **A+W Production**: → `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\...`
*   **A+W Business Pro**: → `P:\Release\...`
*   **Template directory**: → `...\Driver\AUW_ISO\`
*   **Driver directory**: → `...\Driver\`
*   **Production directory**: → `...\ISO\`
*   **Control script (AWBPro)**: → `...\ISO\IGUDRIVERS.BAT`
*   **Control script (AWP)**: → `...\ISO\POSTIGU2.BAS`
*   **CONFIG file (AWBPro)**: → `P:\Release\ISO\XT_AWISO.CFG`
*   **CONFIG file (AWP)**: → `P:\COMMON\XL_Jobrelease.CFG`
*   **Working directory**: → `%APPDATE%\A+W\Techsoft\Release\Tables\`

Template and Driver directory will be overwritten during SETUP.

#### 3.3.1. Process create machine code old driver
Old drivers are drivers executed via individual driver program, e.g. Lisec (`XOPTLBID`), Bayer
1.  OPT2 files are created for the driver in `WorkingDir`.
2.  The script `AppName` is called. The driver program is started and creates the machine code. This is renamed by the script (batch number in file name) and moved to the subdirectory `OUTPUT`.
3.  Call of `PostCreationScript` to copy the machine code to the configured target directory.

**Example:**
```ini
[XL_ISO_XOPTLBID_0]
AppDir=$ROOT$\Release\ISO\xoptlbid
AppName=liframe.BAT
OutputFile=LISEC.DAT
WorkingDir=$USER$\Release\ISO\xoptlbid
PostCreationScript=$ROOT$\Release\ISO\PostIGU2.bas
```

#### 3.3.2. Process create machine code new driver
New drivers are drivers that do not use driver programs. In this case the machine is created directly from the application: e.g. `ALCIMJobRelease` module in AWP for Lisec (Format 1.8x), Lenhardt (Format 5.x),...
1.  The machine code is created in `OutputDir`.
2.  Call of `PostCreationScript` to rename the machine code and to copy the machine code to the configured target directory. Additionally, in AWP a file `SCRIPTRESULT.TXT` is created containing path and file name of the output. This information is written back to table `FEIN_JR_FILES`.

**Example:**
```ini
[XL_ISO_LISEC_0]
OutputFile=LISEC.TRF
OutputFilePattern=LISECxxxxy.TRF
WorkingDir=$USER$\Release\ISO\lisec
PostCreationScript=$ROOT$\Release\ISO\PostIGU2.bas
```

#### 3.3.3. Converting spacer type and spacer colour in machinery code
Depending on the interface it is possible to transfer a spacer type and a spacer colour in the machinery code for spacer bender. Different benders can request different values for identical types. If nothing else is configured, the values are transferred directly from ALCIM to the driver. Therefore, the database fields `POOL_SZR.RAHMENTYP` and `POOL_SZR.RAHMENFARBE` are used.

Most drivers can modify these values via conversion table in the `XL_JobRelease.CFG`. A machine comprehensive standard does not exist. It is necessary to discuss and configure this for each machine together with the customer.

For spacer type there is a conversion matrix `Frame` and for the color `Colour`. For former drivers there is only `Colour`, `Frame` has been added with the interfaces that can handle two values. Please see description of CFG.

#### 3.3.4. Converting gas type in machinery code
The sections of the individual drivers offer the possibility to define a default value for IG with gas fillings. Example: LISEC driver:
```ini
DefaultGas=1
DefaultNoGas=0
```
Additionally, a gas article conversion can be defined in the CFG. Therefore, it is necessary to enable the switch `GasArticleTranslation`. Conversion will be made in a new section `[<Treiber>_ARTICLE_GAS]` in format `<Gasartikel>=<Ausgabewert>`. The conversion can also be made directly in the machine section, but, for a better overview an individual section should be used.

**Example:**
```ini
[XL_ISO_LENHARDT_0]
GasArticleTranslation=Y

[XL_ISO_LENHARDT_ARTICLE_GAS]
1000=1
1015=7
2025=12
```

#### 3.3.5. Specialties of individual drivers
Since the interfaces to the various manufacturers are quite different, the `XL_JobRelease.CFG` does not contain a parameter record valid for all drivers.

**Format 01 Lisec (XOPTLBID) - `[XL_ISO_XOPTLBID_0]`**
This is the old LISEC format created with the driver `XOPTLBID.EXE`. The base contains the `XOPTLBID` directory including all necessary files.

There are 2 scripts for parameter `AppName`: `LIFRAME.BAT` for bender or `LISEAL.BAT` for sealer. The script calls the driver `XOPTLBID.EXE` including parameters. This includes – among others - the version number. Maybe, the script has to be adapted. Check with the customer which version the machine can handle. When calling the `XOPTLBID.EXE` via parameter „`-?`" a list appears including all possible parameters.
*   `LIFRAME.BAT` → `XOPTLBID.EXE -2.14`
*   `LISEAL.BAT` → `XOPTLBID.EXE -V3.3 -L`

**Format 06 Lenhardt (Format 5.x) - `[XL_ISO_LENHARDT_0]`**
The driver always transfers the spacer type from ALCIM (`POOL_SZR.RAHMENTYP`) increased by +1, in case of Georgian Bars +4 and for cast resin +8.
This is important for Lenhardt IG line. If this format is used for a Lenhardt bender, you can turn-off adding of +4 or +8 by `OutputForBending`. +1 is still added.

**LECHECK**
For sealer `LECHECK` must run to calculate the bottom edge. It will be written into field `MZO_ROUTE_MAP.AUFSTELLKANTE` or `MZO_EINSTELLEN.KANTE_IN`. If `LECHECK` is installed it must be activated in `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`.
```ini
DoCheck=Y
CheckLineRestrictions=1
```
The machinery manufacturer delivers a `LECHECK` version to the customer matching the machinery (Bystronic/Lenhardt). This is not an A+W product. `LECHECK` must be installed to the directory configured in the `XL_JoRelease.CFG` (`LeCheckWorkingDir`). If this is not the case, the CFG needs to be adapted.

**Format 09 Lisec (Format 1.8x) - `[XL_ISO_LISEC_0]`**
```ini
FormatVersion=2.40
```
If this switch is not set or the value is not supported, the first supported interface version (Version 1.80) is used. New machines cannot handle this version. You can find the possible values in the CFG description.

**Format 09 Lisec (Format 1.8x) – KSR and LineServer**
It exist to special LISEC interface, LISEC KSR and LineServer.
`LISEC KSR` is a machine for edge processing which can be inside the IGU line or a separate machine. If it is inside the IGU line the controlling for the KSR will be inside the sealer machine code and has to be configured in the `XL_JOBRELEASE` section.

If it is a separate machine you have to configure detailed scheduling lot type 1400 (KSR). During JobRelease use action `BENDER_SEALER8` which generate a KSR machine code for lot type 1400. It uses the `XL_JOPRELEASE` section `XL_ISO_LISEC_11`. Standard Output directory is `$SERVERDIR$\PROD\KSR\`.

Read chapter for processing machines for more information.

Output for `LISEC LineServer` can generated independent from machinery allocation. Use action `BENDER_SEALER9` during the JobRelease. The configuration happens in `XL_JOBRELEASE` section `XL_ISO_LISEC_10`. Standard Output directory is `$SERVERDIR$\PROD\LineServer\`.

**Free shapes for BENDER and IG Line**
An interface exists for individual drivers for free shapes (shape 99). The following switches must be set in the CFG file:
*   `FilterShape99=N`
    Real shape 99 items are not transferred to the driver.
*   `UseShapeFile=Y`
    Path of SN drawings are transferred to the driver.
*   `WriteShape99=Y`
    The driver writes shape 99 for all line items where an SN drawing exist.
*   `DXFFilePath=`
    For LISEC it is necessary to configure the path (LISEC can handle max. 40 characters) for the DXF file. Maybe, this path must not be a UNC path. It has to be reached on the PC of release and the LISEC - PC.
*   `DXFOutputFilePath=`
    (Optional for LISEC) does the same like `DXFFilePath` and has to link to the same directory. It will use for the driver, UNC path is possible. In the machine code the value from `DXFFilePath` will be entered.

Presently [2011.02 #180978], this function exists for the LISEC and LENHARDT 5.x format. From SN version 2009 5.8.29.8209 or 2011 5.9.7.836 on and from `ALCIMJobRelease` 2009 patch on.

**Create bender code without bender text**
To control a bender without bender text, the check of bender text must be turned-off. If not, a warning appears and the machinery code will not be generated.
`ThrowExceptionOnUninitializedBenderTexts=N`
`[Trace] XTH10383=N`

**How does old driver create bender code with edge individual sealing depth?**
If a spacer record with `POOL_MODELL.BEARB_NR=-1` and `POOL_MODELL.ISROOTSHAPE=10` exist, you can use the following `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` parameter to write the real spacer geometry into `OPT2DAT`. Activate the parameter in `[GENERAL]` section:
`UseExplicitSpacerGeometry=Y`
In the driver Section you have to set the following parameter:
`UseExplicitSpacerGeometry =Y`
For `RJKAN` driver use the following parameter to manipulate the sealing value:
```ini
DefaultSealingValue=0
UseSealingFromCharacterhost=N
SpacerDisplacementMode=0
```
It could be that you have a parameter `UseExpliciteSpacerGeometrie` in the CFG file, this is a wrong parameter. Use parameter `UseExplicitSpacerGeometry`.

### 3.4. Configure Sealer in A+W Production Terminal IG-IN
It is possible to generate machine code direct in A+W Production Terminal, so it isn't need to generate it during job release. This works since version 5.5 + hotfix. The following example was done for LENHARDT sealer code.

If you activate this function, a machine code is generated during loading a lot. If you press produce, some information will be send to the machine (e.g. the barcode), with this information the IG line can identify the machine code record in the interface file.

The machine code will be generate with the module `ALCIMJobrelease.DLL`. The file has to be generate in a directory which is known in A+W Production Terminal and A+W Production Terminal copy this files into a target directory.

`ALCIMJobRelease.DLL` is execute on the server where PPSWebService is running. The windows user is the user of PPSWebService.

It could be important to define an `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` for this windows user for the settings which deviate. For LENHARDT it is the setting `PostCreationScript`, for A+W Production Terminal you don't need to execute a script and the standard script doesn't work here because it is optimized for machine code generation in job release.

`ALCIMJobRelease.DLL` has to generate the machine code in a directory where A+W Production Terminal has access. It can't be the `$USER$` directory, because the User directory of PPSWebService isn't the same user of A+W Production Terminal who copy the files later.

Here an example how the `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` for the PPSWebService user could look like:
```ini
[XL_ISO_LENHARDT_0]
WorkingDir=$USER$\Release\ISO\Lenhardt
OutputDir=$SERVERDIR$\Prod\TTV_LEN\Temp
PostCreationScript=
```
In the A+W Production Terminal configuration you have to configure the machinery allocation machine ID, a source directory where `ALCIMJobRelease.DLL` generate the machine code (for LENHARDT it is the same value of `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` parameter `OutputDir`), a target directory where the machine code files are copied and a file mask which describe the files which should be copy (e.g. `*.len`).

### 3.5. Configure Sealer/Bender in JobTV
In A+W Production Terminal JobTV you can generate machine code from the release dialog for an individual lite.
The driver call must be activate and a lot type of the machine must be set.

In `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` in the section of used machine a Parameter `ParameterString` must be configured to define the path where the machine code should be stored:
`ParameterString=059;OutputPathNet=\\MyServer\Trans\Prod\TTVBender\;SilentMode=1`
`059` is the ASCII value (;) of the delimiter of the parameter value. This parameter string will be transfer into `PostCreationScript` which uses the value of `OutputPathNet` as output directory for the machine code. `SilentMode` must be set, so our standard `PostCreationScript` (`PostIGU2.BAS` version 6.4.1 or higher) make no output messages which doesn't work because the script is running in background in the PPS WebService.

In JobTV select the lites you want produce and a machine code with our normal JobRelease function will be generate in `OutputPathNet` with always the similar name based on `OutputFilePattern`. So if you release the next lites, the old machine code file will be overwritten.

### 3.6. Troubleshooting
In case of problems with generated machinery code, the configuration file `XL_JobRelease.CFG` as well as the `AWISO LOG` file is needed apart from the machinery code. The `AWISO` file is activated in the `XL_JobRelease.CFG` in the machinery section by the switch `WriteAwisoSavForCheck`.
Additionally, the `XL_JobRealease` contains a `[Trace]` section to activated further LOG files. For old drivers, the drivers, driver configuration, and the generated `OPT2` files are needed.

**PostCreationScript POSTIGU2.BAS cannot be called**
A cryptic message appears. This happens in case of "old" drivers that generates OPT2 files. Machinery code is generated via script, but the script `POSTIGU2.BAS` cannot be called afterwards.
The switch `OutputFile` in the `XL_JobRelease.CFG` must be set, even for drivers that do not need the switch. The value is transferred to the `PostCreationScript`.

**Message „Bender text not initialized!“ although bender texts exist**
In case of this message machinery code is not created. Either an item of a batch has no bender text or ALCIM is set to a wrong bender text type (`POOL_TXT.TEXT_TYP` 1000 or 1001).
Location: **[ALCIM / General / Job Release / Bender Text Type]**

**Performance problem while executing LECHECK or another check program**
If a machine has many logical machines a check program like `LECHECK` can cause performance problems. This check program is executed for each logical machine, although it is requested only once for the physical machine.
This has been corrected from patch 2011 on (AWDesk #247464). To enable the behaviour use the following switch:
```sql
INSERT INTO parameter (lastmodstation, lastmodzeit, bereich, eintrag, text, nummer, modul)
VALUES ('INIT', CURRENT, 'MZO_CHECKING_IG_LINE', 'ONCE', '1', 0, 'MZO');
```

**Message: XMM10229: No valid Lisec shape found for FRM**
For some A+W shapes no LISEC shape exist (e.g. A+W shape 92, 93). To, solve this use the DXF interface for the driver, if possible.

**Run old 16-Bit driver in 64-Bit OS**
Some of the old driver (like `LENLINIE.EXE`) are old 16-bit driver which doesn't work in 64-Bit OS. Development can convert this old driver, but this is expansive and this driver die out. If it is known a request to development can be made in advance of the project.

Alternatively you can use an emulator: AWDesk #217872/#127638
In some installations with `LENLINIE.EXE` we use the free emulator from http://www.dosbox.com. If you do this, install the emulator and execute in our BAT script the driver with the emulator:
```bat
"c:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74\DOSBox.exe" -exit -c "MOUNT C %~5" -c "C:" -c "SET XOPTFRM=C:\Lenhardt" -c "C:\lenlinie.exe -e -ln -b -v" -c "exit"
```
The `"-c"` Parameter send commands to the emulator. First mount actual working directory as drive C and go to drive C. Next execute the driver and at the end exit the emulator.

## 4. Georgian Bars
For Georgian Bar production we need paper with a Georgian Bar sketch, also some machines can be controlled direct with a machine code.

### 4.1. Report
Paper can be printed direct with A+W CAD Designer (Bars). This technique is no longer recommended because you do not have much influence on the design of the papers.

It is recommended to generate the papers via CrystalReport, for this we have a standard report: `AUW_Grill_list.RPT` (`$SERVERDIR$\Reports\`)

About special CrystalReports functions, the `AWD` file will be execute direct in A+W CAD Designer (Bars) and a sketch and additional information will be send into the Report.

This requires an `AWD` file for each Georgian Bar. The file can be generated during Import, if not the report works but without the most information.

The print with crystal reports has a lot of advantages, but one disadvantage. If you have the same Georgian bars in both spacer of a triple IGU, you get a page for each spacer. In the old solution it was possible to print one page.

#### 4.1.1. Print direct with A+W CAD Designer (Bars)
The old way to print a grill list still works but isn't configured in the standard. There A+W Production controls A+W CAD Designer (Bars). The printout happens before JobRelease or direct in JobRelease with the action `MUNTINS_PRINT`.
In JobRelease Dialog add a simple On/Off-Action control for action `MUNTINS_PRINT`.

### 4.2. AWD file generation
If no `AWD` file is send from order entry via `ORDERXML`, A+W Production has a function to generate an `AWD` file automatically during import.

#### 4.2.1. Configuration until version 5.5
The parameter `[ITEMS45ALCIM / AWDESIGN]` to activate the function could be set only with an SQL Editor, it doesn't exist in A+W Production configuration (AWDesk ticket for develop the missing parameter in ALCIM: #252438).
```sql
SELECT bereich, eintrag, nummer, modul, text FROM parameter WHERE bereich='ITEMS4ALCIM' AND eintrag='AWDESIGN';
```
If the record exists, in column `text` the path for the `AWD` directory is stored. This is the same path like in `AWD20.INI`. Standard value: `$SERVERDIR$\AWDesign\Pool\`

If no record exists, a record has to be inserted. The filed `NUMMER` is important, standard is 75 but this depends on the other parameter of `bereich='ITEMS4ALCIM'`.

Read the following documentation file for more information:
`\\jupiter\DOKU_DocuWare\ALCIM2000\Import\DirekterDatenimport\Installation_Configuration\AddCustomizingSteps.SQL`

#### 4.2.2. Configuration since version 6.0
The file path to the AWDesign files is used from the standard parameter `[POOL_GEORGIANBARS / DATAFILEPATH]`. If the parameter is empty the standard value `$SERVERDIR$\AWDesign\Pool\` is used.

**I4A**
With parameter `[ITEMS4ALCIM_SETTINGS / SEQUENCE_OF_EXECUTION]` you configure the sequence of task which can be started during import interface Items4Alcim (I4A). Enter the task `AWD` in the list to activate the AWDesign file generation.

**O4P**
In import interface Orders4Production (O4P) a thread with name `AWDesign` has to be configured for import orders and reservations.

### 4.3. Machine control from A+W CAD Designer (Bars)
If you want control a saw for grills, you can use the action `MUNTINS_MACHINE_CONTROL` in the standard JobRelease dialog.
This is a simple On/Off-Action control for action `MUNTINS_MACHINE_CONTROL`.

To make it work a driver is need. Configure the driver in grill setting of AWP configuration **[Rough Scheduling → Grill Settings]**.
... and in the configuration of AWDesign (`AWD20.INI`):
```ini
[Exports]
MaschineNames=RWSPROSS
OptimizeLength=@DISABLE
OptimizePrintList=@DISABLE
OptimizeRestLengthFile=SoptRest.DAT
OptimizeBorder=0
OptimizeMaxBoxes=100
OptimizeMinRest=200
OptimizeMinItem=5
OptimizeMaxItem=20
OptimizeMinYield=0.90
OptimizeExpand=2
InvertSorting=1
MaxNumberOfLines=0

[RWSPROSS]
MenuEntryName=R+R Spossenmontage
DriverName=RWSPROSS.DRV
FileName=@RUNNUMBER
FileExtention=RWB
DriverCode=2240420
PostExeName=awd.bat
PreExeName=@NONE
PostExeWaitForTermination=@YES
PostExeParameter=@NONE
PreExeParameter=@NONE
PreExeWaitForTermination=@YES
```
This is an example for the R&R grill saw configuration.
The name of the machine can be maximum 8 characters long name, in this example `RWSPROSS`. The name is set as driver in A+W Production configuration and in `AWD20.INI` in `MaschineNames` and section name.

"`[MaschineName]DriverCode`" is a `ONEWAY` code generated with the following parameter from `AWD20.INI`:
`[AWDesign]CompanyName + [Exports]MaschineNames + [MaschineName]DriverName`

The driver will be execute direct from A+W CAD Designer (Bars), after this the batch configured in `PostExName` is execute to copy and delete the machine code from user directory to an output directory.

If the configuration was OK, your see the driver in A+W CAD Designer (Bars) in **[File → Export]**.

### 4.4. Machine control from XLCLASS
New machine driver for Georgian Bars are configured like driver for bender and sealer with XLCLASS (`XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`) functions.

In machinery allocation you configure the Georgian bar machine with machine type 102. For this machine type a machine in A+W Production, with the right format and a section linked to `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`, has to be configured.

In detailed scheduling the lot configuration must be changed that a lot for Georgian bar production (standard 1300) is generated.

In release dialog you configure a new sealer/bender action and use the script `JOBRELEASE_ALLFORTYPE.VB`.
In the `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` the `PostCreationScript POSTIGU2.BAS` must be enabled to copy the machine code into the directory defined in ReleaseDialog configuration.

## 5. Processing machines (XL)
This chapter describes machines whose machine code generated at job-release (XL Class) and the interfaces corresponding to that of the sealer and bender.

**LISEC KSR**
LISEC KSR is a seaming machine which can be integrated in an IG line, but also available individually.
If the KSR integrated into an IG line, it will be controlled with the machine code of the IG line, no extra machine needs to define. But if the KSR is alone, it can be used for all sheets independent of the final product. For this a machine code is only needed for sheets which are not build in an IGU, sheets for IGU are still handled with the IG machine code. To solve this configure 2 machines, one for IG line without machine code and one for the rest with machine code.

**FOREL Processing Machine**
Entwickelt über #329103. Hier wird wie bei der LISEC KSR die ISO Schnittstelle verwendet um eine Bearbeitungsmaschine anzusteuern. Es gibt die Möglichkeit die Maschine über das alte FOREL Format anzusteuern (ID 3 [`XL_ISO_FOREL`]) oder über das neue Format (ID 18 [`XL_ISO_FOREL_IG`]) ab Version 5.5 oder als Hotfix in Version 2011.

### 5.1. Processing machine in A+W Production
Processing machines in job release is not a standard function. In our standard database, the function is prepared, but it must be enabled.

#### 5.1.1. Configure machine type 103
It must be ensured that the machine type 103 is defined in the database for machinery allocation. This type is used to generate a corresponding machine code during job release (1 = cutting, 100 = IG line, 101 = bender, 102 = Georgian bars, 103 = processing machine).

Normally, A+W Production automatically creates a corresponding record in table `MZO_MASCHINTYP`, but not for type 103 (AWDesk ticket #283650 to resolve this situation).

Check if record already exist:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mzo_maschintyp WHERE id_typ = 103;
```
If the record is missing add record manually:
```sql
-- SQLServer
INSERT INTO mzo_maschintyp (SPERRSTATION, SPERRZEIT, LASTMODSTATION, LASTMODZEIT, ID_TYP, [TEXT], PARAM_DB_TBL_NAME, DRIVER_CALL_METHOD, EXKLUSIV_FLAG, PFLICHT_FLAG, IMPLIZIT_FLAG)
VALUES ('------', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '------', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '103', 'PROCESSINGLINE', 'MZO_BEARBEITUNGSMASCHINE,KOMPONENTEN_ID,BESCHREIBUNG', 'Methode (Driver-Call)', '0', '1', '1');

-- Informix
INSERT INTO mzo_maschintyp (SPERRSTATION, SPERRZEIT, LASTMODSTATION, LASTMODZEIT, ID_TYP, TEXT, PARAM_DB_TBL_NAME, DRIVER_CALL_METHOD, EXKLUSIV_FLAG, PFLICHT_FLAG, IMPLIZIT_FLAG)
VALUES ('------', CURRENT, '------', CURRENT, '103', 'PROCESSINGLINE', 'MZO_BEARBEITUNGSMASCHINE,KOMPONENTEN_ID,BESCHREIBUNG', 'Methode (Driver-Call)', '0', '1', '1');
```

#### 5.1.2. Configure processing machine
A processing machine is defined like a sealer or bender, only there is no dialogue for this (AWDesk ticket #283650 to resolve this situation).

Without dialogue, the only option entries for a corresponding machine manually adjust the table `MZO_BEARBEITUNGSMASCHINE`.
```sql
SELECT * FROM mzo_bearbeitungsmaschine;
```
Important are the following columns:
*   `KOMPONENTEN_ID`: A unique name that is selected in the machinery allocation
*   `MASCHINENTYP`: 103 (currently there are no other types)
*   `FORMAT_ID`: Number of driver from `ALCIMJOBRELEASE.DLL`, the same number as for bender and sealer (999 = no machine code).
*   `AUFRUF_SEKTION`: Section of the driver in `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`.

**Machine LISEC KSR** used in the Standard the format 9 and section 11: `[XL_ISO_LISEC_11]`
The following SQL statements insert a record for a LISEC KSR:
```sql
INSERT INTO mzo_bearbeitungsmaschine (LASTMODSTATION, LASTMODZEIT, KOMPONENTEN_ID, BESCHREIBUNG, MASCHINENTYP, FORMAT_ID, AUFRUF_SEKTION)
VALUES ('INIT', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'LISEC_KSR', 'KSR Lisec format 2.40', 103, 9, 11);
```

**Machine FOREL KSR** used in the Standard the format 18 and section 0: `[XL_ISO_FOREL_IG_0]`
The following SQL statements insert a record for a FOREL IGU:
```sql
INSERT INTO mzo_bearbeitungsmaschine (LASTMODSTATION, LASTMODZEIT, KOMPONENTEN_ID, BESCHREIBUNG, MASCHINENTYP, FORMAT_ID, AUFRUF_SEKTION)
VALUES ('INIT', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'FOREL_IG', 'FOREL Processing machine', 103, 18, 0);
```

The following SQL statements insert a record for manual machine:
```sql
INSERT INTO mzo_bearbeitungsmaschine (LASTMODSTATION, LASTMODZEIT, KOMPONENTEN_ID, BESCHREIBUNG, MASCHINENTYP, FORMAT_ID, AUFRUF_SEKTION)
VALUES ('INIT', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'HAND', 'Hand control (manuelle Steuerung)', 103, 999, 0);
```

#### 5.1.3. Configure XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG
It must be ensured that the relevant section of the selected driver exists in the `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`. For LISEC KSR in the standard that would be the section `[XL_ISO_LISEC_11]`.

**How to get the edge processing into AWISO interface?**
Enable the parameter `UseProcessings=Y` in `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` section `[GENERAL]`, so processing are now known. In the section of the driver also enable this parameter `UseProcessings=Y`, so processing are used for this driver.

In the driver section you have the parameter `ProcessingTypeMode`, which configure which information should be send into the machine code (e.g. as LISEC type):
*   `0` = `pool_bearbeit.klasse` (Standard)
*   `1` = `pool_bearbeit.typ` + `pool_bearbeit.klasse` (used e.g. for LISEC LineServer)

If you use `ProcessingTypeMode=1` you can manipulate the value which is send in the machine code with matrix parameter `ProcessingType[n1]=n2,n3,n4`
*   `n1`=Extension for Keyword '`ProcessingType`' Valid(0..99)
*   `n2`=Value to set for Processing Type (value for machine, find in interface docu)
*   `n3`=Value read from field '`POOL_BEARBEIT.TYP`' (-1 ignore typ)
*   `n4`=Value read from field '`POOL_BEARBEIT.KLASSE`' (-1 ignore klasse)

For FOREL we have `ProcessingType` and a second matrix for application name on the FOREL machine `ProcessingText[n1]=n2,n3`
*   `n1`=Extension for Keyword '`ProcessingText`' Valid(0..99)
*   `n2`= Value read from field '`POOL_BEARBEIT.TYP`' OR '`.AW_BEARBTYP`' (not clear)
*   `n3`=application name on FOREL machine
`ProcessingText0=1000,SFIL3`
`ProcessingText1=1005,SFIL4`
`ProcessingText2=1010,SFIL5`

**Write DXF file for line items**
A DXF interface exists to transfer free shapes (shape 99) into the machine code. This happens for all line items where a SN drawing exists. The following switches must be set in the CFG file:
*   `FilterShape99=N`
    Real shape 99 items are not transferred to the driver.
*   `UseShapeFile=Y`
    Path of SN drawings are transferred to the driver.
*   `WriteShape99=Y`
    The driver writes shape 99 for all line items where an SN drawing exist.
*   `DXFFilePath=`
    For LISEC it is necessary to configure the path (LISEC can handle max. 40 characters) for the DXF file. Maybe, this path must not be a UNC path. It has to be reached on the PC of release and the LISEC - PC.
*   `DXFOutputFilePath=`
    (Optional for LISEC) does the same like `DXFFilePath` and has to link to the same directory. It will use for the driver, UNC path is possible. In the machine code the value from `DXFFilePath` will be entered.

This feature isn't implemented for KSR interface, but it should be done: #332650

#### 5.1.4. Processing master data
All edge processing for machine code generation must be assigned to category 1 (Edge Processing) in master data.

#### 5.1.5. Configure machinery allocation
The machines involved must be associated with the type 103, this can be done in the MZO only when creating a new machine.

Currently it is not possible to select the component ID from `MZO_BEARBEITUNGSMASCHINE.KOMPONENTEN_ID` (AWDesk ticket #283650 to resolve this situation).

If you want to assign the component ID or a machine afterwards the `ID_TYP` 103, this is only possible through a SQL editor on the table `MZO_REALMACHINE`. `PARAM_DB_TABLE_KEY` is the link to the record in table `MZO_BERBEITUNGSMASCHIEN.KOMPONENTEN_ID`: “`LISEC_KSR`”, "`FOREL_IG`".
```sql
SELECT * FROM mzo_realmaschine WHERE id_phys = ?;
UPDATE mzo_realmaschine SET id_typ = 103, param_db_table_key = '<MZO_BERBEITUNGSMASCHIEN.KOMPONENTEN_ID>' WHERE id_phys = ?;
```
**Attention:** If the processing type can be assigned to other processing machines which are no KSR, you have to set this machines to machine type 103 too. Set the component ID to the manual processing machine `HAND`.
```sql
UPDATE mzo_realmaschine SET id_typ = 103, param_db_table_key = 'HAND' WHERE id_phys = ?;
```

#### 5.1.6. Configure detailed scheduling
A detailed scheduling lot type is need, if you want generate machine code during JobRelease. If machine code is generate only with A+W Production Terminal, you need no special Lot.

The detailed scheduling must be configured to read processing: `[FEIN_TREATMENTS / READPOOLBEARBEIT] = 1`

For processing machines the detailed scheduling lot type 1400 is reserved. This is defined in **[Master Data → Detailed Scheduling → Lot Types]**.

Processing assigned on the lot types make the difference whether a machine code can be generated or not. If no lot type 1400 is found, no machine code will be generated even if the correct machine is allocated.

#### 5.1.7. Configure JobRelease
In the standard release dialog there is the option KSR. This generates machine code for a LISEC KSR that is configured in the standard.
The checkbox is linked to the Bender/Sealer action `BENDER_SEALER8`.
The machine ID should be 0, so that the machine code will be generated for the complete lot 1400. A solution for each machine isn't implemented.

### 5.2. Machine control via A+W Production Terminal
A script must be configured in the A+W Production Terminal, which is given the order number, item and part number. In the script, the processing lot 1400 is fed with the transferred items and a machine output is started. If there is no processing lot available, the lot is set to 0 in the script and a corresponding output is generated for the corresponding processing.

From the A+W Production Terminal Processing only one item is processed at a time, here the quantity must also be transferred to the script. In the A+W Production Terminal Order with a list of single units, the marked units are passed to the script, here no quantity is needed, each record is used with quantity 1.

The following steps must be executed in the script:
*   `AlcimJobRelease.USERRELEASE1`: Create object
*   `STDMETHOD(BeginDefinitionUserLotEx)`: Loads the object
    *   `[in] BSTR ConnectString`: → Connect-String of database
    *   `[in] BSTR StationID`: → Station ID
    *   `[in] int ShowProgress`: → Enable progress indicator=1 disable=0
    *   `[in] int ShowErrorMessages`: → Enable error messages=1 disable=0
    *   `[in] int ShowErrorList`: → Enable error list=1 disable=0
    *   `[in] BSTR ListOfMachines`: → E.g.: '5, 6, 88' = ID of alternative phys. machines
    *   `[in] long SizeOfList`: → 3 (three alternatives in list)
    *   `[in] long ProcessingNumber`: → Generally valid processing number (0|-999 for IG/spacer)
    *   `[in] long LotType`: → Def. in `FEIN_BEARBTYP`, e.g. 700, 1200 or 1400; 0 creates a lot if none exists
    *   `[out] long`: → Return value of function
*   `STDMETHOD(AddToUserLotEx)`: adds unit to object
    *   `[in] long order`: → Order number
    *   `[in] long item`: → Item number
    *   `[in] long sub_item`: → Sub item
    *   `[in] long partnumber`: → Part number
    *   `[in] long processingnumber`: → Processing number (-999=use generally valid)
    *   `[in] long amount`: → Quantity to be produced
    *   `[out] long Return value of function`
*   `STDMETHOD(AddToUserLotExWithLabel)`: like `AddToUserLotEx` plus one additional parameter
    *   `[in] BSTR labelnumber`: → Label number
*   `CreateOutputUserLotCompact()`: creates output in file

#### 5.2.1. Example
In the Designer a new script must be configured, here the fields are defined, which are transferred into the `SKRIPT_SELEKTION`. Required is the order number, item number, part number and possibly the quantity.

You can call the script via the menu or define a button for calling the script.

In the `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` a `PostCreationScript` is defined if you want to output the machine code also in the batch release. You cannot use the standard `POSTIGU2.BAS` here, since it is only intended for batch release. Here a copy is used which has configured the output path and file name in the script.

If you want to generate an output only via the A+W Production Terminal, then simply deactivate `PostCreationScript` in the `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG` machine section and set `WorkingDir` to the final directory. Set the name of the file fixed via `OutputFilePattern` (batch number is 0 and lot 1, placeholders x and y should be used in `OutputFilePattern`).

**Example:**
```ini
[XL_ISO_FOREL_IG_0]
UseProcessings=Y
;WorkingDir=$USER$\Release\ISO\Forel_IG
WorkingDir=$SERVERDIR$\PROD\FOREL
;PostCreationScript=$ROOT$\Release\ISO\PostIGU2.bas
OutputFilePattern=FOREL.TFF
```

### 5.3. Troubleshooting
**Message "Lot type not defined” during JobRelease**
If the reason in the message isn't the problem, than it could happens if you use an old `P:\SCRIPTS\JOBRELEASE.VB`. The script needs the following changes:
VB.NET-Skript for Initializing of `AlcimJobRelease.dll`.
Version: 2.32.0
History: 23.07.2012 DLA: If no machine ID is configured, execute `CreateAllForType_CS`.

**Input box opens during JobRelease**
If you use the Standard `POSTIGU2.BAS` an InputBox open to enter the output path for the KSR machine code. The path will not transferred to the script, this is a known problem and will be solved with #283759. Until a solution, use a copy of the script and enter the output path fix in the script.

**Message: XMM10229: No valid Lisec shape found for FRM**
For some A+W shapes no LISEC shape exist (e.g. A+W shape 92, 93). To, solve this use the DXF interface for the driver, if possible.

## 6. Processing machines (SN)
This chapter is for configuration of processing machines which are controlled with special driver build for A+W CAD Designer (Shapes); e.g. `CAMDXF` driver.

In the normal process an A+W Production Terminal Processing called a machine driver configured in A+W CAD Designer (Shapes). In most cases a SN file is needed.

A driver package contains a section in A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) configuration file `SN.INI` and driver executable plus BATCH files for control.

### 6.1. SN.INI
In a common installation the global `SN.INI` is stored in `$SERVERDIR$\SN\`. In this configuration the base setting for the ERP and PPS system are stored.

For a processing machine the standard deviating switches are stored in an additional `SN.INI`. For the deviation the A+W Production Station-ID can be used or if processing machine is configured on an independent PC a self-defined ID can be configured: `$SERVERDIR$\SN\User\<Station-ID>\`

Configuration of `SN.INI` will be done with the A+W CAS Designer (Shapes) Config Tool and can set for each User.

In the `SN.INI` for each processing machine minimum one section must exist. In this section set of switches has to be configured. To activate this processing machine, the name of this section must add in the switch `Machines` in section `[Customer]`.

Often 2 section for one machine exist. One section for control by A+W Production Terminal and a second section for control manually direct with a SN drawing in A+W CAD Designer (Shapes).

The different in the section will be the parameter `ExportName`. If controlled by PT, the value must be `@EXTERN` (value is set by PT), for manually use the value must be `@NAME` (Name of the loaded SN file).

The SN view, which should use for the driver, must defended in the parameter `VIEW`. The driver call happens with a BATCH file which is defined in the parameter `WindowsPif`.

#### 6.1.1. Example Section
```ini
[Customer]
Machines = ALCIM2000 ALCIM2000I FORVET

[FORVET]

```

### 6.2. Configure A+W Production Terminal Processing
First make a copy of the standard PT Processing Parameter-Set `AUW_PROCESSING` for your processing machine.

Next generate a PT Station and allocate the generated PT Processing Parameter-Set as default to this new station.

The SN parameter section offers some basic settings for all Shaping & Nesting drivers.
*   **Driver settings**: This allows to edit the list of installed drivers.
*   **Standard driver**: This is shown as default driver in PT. The setting must contain the "Display Name" of the desired SN driver.
*   **SN Command**: The "SN command" setting can contain functions that are executed after opening the SN drawing. Several function numbers can be passed, each separated by ','. The numbers correspond to menu entries in Shaping & Nesting (`SNDOMenuItem` is called internally, the header `snmenu.h` defines the corresponding constants, see also `\\jupiter\DocuWare\Shaping_Nesting\!General\Installation_Configuration\wwSNINI.doc`). Sample function numbers: 1806 - show all dimensions, 1807 – show only dimensions from the current view, 1793 – show dimension in mm, 1794 - show dimensions in fractional inches, 1795 - show dimensions in decimal inches).

In the Parameter-Set you have to configure your driver. If it is needed to configure several drivers, they can be selected directly in a combo box in PT.

Driver configuration options:
*   **Alternative driver** [optional]: If this driver is set to need SN files, you can configure here an alternative driver which is used if the loaded unit has no SN file.
*   **Display Name**: The name which is displayed in PT Combo Box for driver selection.
*   **Load driver automatically** [optional]: After each change of order number and line item a note will displayed and the driver is executed automatically. Default value is false.
*   **Permitted RPNOS** [optional]: List of registration points which are allowed for this machine driver.
*   **Generate NC Code**: NC code for this machine should be generate. Default value is false.
*   **Path to SN Batch Files** [optional]: Path of batch files for trigger driver. Is used for simplified SN control.
*   **SBName Special Mode** [optional]: Output of several `SBNameXX.TRX` files with one final driver call. Attention: The driver will also not execute after change of order number or line item, it is called only when all `SBNameXX.TRX` are written. Default value is false.
*   **SN Driver View**: SN file is open with this SN view. Default value: DRILL.
*   **SNExportMachine**: Section of the machine in `SN.INI` which is called.
*   **Use Link to SN Panorama** [optional]: Machine driver will be execute by Panorama.
*   **Driver needs SN file**: Set on true if driver needs a SN drawing. For units without SN drawing, driver will not available in PT. Default value is false.

### 6.3. Available Drivers
The available drivers will not be installed with our DISKSETS. You'll find all available drivers in the following directory:
`\\jupiter\TECHSOFT_Glasbaum\SHAP_NES\DRIVER\`

The driver and corresponding BATCH files must be stored in `$SERVERDIR$\SN\User\Default\`. At start of A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) this files will be copied into folder `%appdata%\A+W\Techsoft\SN\`, if the files doesn't exist.

If a driver must updated with a newer version, it isn't enough to replace the files in `$SERVERDIR$\SN\User\Default\`; the files in `%appdata%\A+W\Techsoft\SN\` must be deleted.

#### 6.3.1. Intermac

## 7. Processing machines (XL – SN)
This chapter describes machine code driver which are controlled by job release (XL Class), but execute an SN driver to generate the machine code.

### 7.1. FORVET KEY
FORVET has a processing machine park with cutting table and edge work machines which are controlled direct by FORVET software. A+W Production transfer during job release all needed data to this machine (DXF file for each sheet), the FORVET software optimize the glass by itself and control the machines. Via FILEMUX interface the machine park can send A+W Production the status of the sheets, e.g. sheet is cut, sheet is seamed. This is possible, because we send our barcode number into the interface.

On the edge work stations optional A+W Production Terminal can be installed which generate the machine code via SN driver like we do this for each single machine.

#### 7.1.1. Configuration A+W Production
In A+W Production a processing machine for machine type 103 and a detailed scheduling lot for this processing must be configured like it is described in the corresponding chapter in this document.

The machine configured in table `MZO_BEARBEITUNSGMASCHINE` (can set in machinery allocation editor in further version) uses the format number 24 and must be section 11:

| komponenten_id | beschreibung | maschinentyp | format_id | aufruf_sektion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FORVET_KEY | FORVET KEY Processing Machine | 103 | 24 | 11 |

In our example we use the component ID “FORVET_KEY” which is linked to the machine in machinery allocation: `MZO_REALMASCHINE.PARAM_DB_TABLE_KEY`

#### 7.1.2. Configure XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG
It is need to set the following general parameter in the CFG:
```ini
[GENERAL]
SplitItemToUnitsDefault=Y
WriteFeinJrTables=Y
```
For the driver a section `[XL_ISO_FORVET_11]` is used. Use the section from standard configuration file (`AUW_XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`) as base. The following parameter are special for this driver:
*   `NcExportMachine=FORVETJR`
    Link to machine section configured in SN.INI
*   `NcWorkingDir=$USER$\SN\`
    The folder where A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) executes the SN driver
*   `NcOutputFilePath=$SERVERDIR$\Prod\FORVET\`
    Output folder where the driver direct store the machine code
*   `UseBatchSubFolder=Y`
    In `NcOutputFilePath` a sub directory for a batch is generated.
*   `RemoveAllFilesFirst=Y`
    if files exist in the `NcOutputFilePath` and sub folder, they will be deleted before the driver generate new ones.
*   `NCDriverMode=2`
    Controls how the SN driver generate the machine code: 0=Default; 1=AlcimSNDraw->LaunchNCCode; 2=AlcimSNDraw->LaunchNCCodeForPacLayer()

#### 7.1.3. Configure SN driver
The newest FORVET CamDXF driver is need and must be configured like all SN driver. It must be configured for the A+W Production station which is doing the JobRelease.
`\\jupiter\TECHSOFT_Glasbaum\SHAP_NES\DRIVER\CAM-DXF\Albwir.MC.CamDxf.Forvet\`

This driver package include a configuration package for this driver in job release. In this package you find an `Albwir.MC.CamDxf.ForvetDxf.config`, a `SN.INI` (only with the specials for this machine) and the script `Albwir.MC.CamDxf.ForvetJR.bat` to execute special for this driver.

The machine in `SN.INI` must be configured in the section which is defined in `XL_JOBRELEASE.CFG`, in our example `[FORVETJR]`. In this section the Parameter `ExportSurfaceProcessing=1` must be set.

In this section the script is execute in the `WindowsPIF` parameter. In this execute command, don't use the script parameter `ToolTVFilterCheck` like it is need for execution in A+W Production Terminal:
`WindowsPIF = Albwir.MC.Launcher.exe Albwir.MC.CamDxf.ForvetJR.bat`

One different in the script for job release and for A+W Production Terminal is, that the driver EXE will be execute in the script with the parameter `-BATCH`, to suppress the user input for every item:
`start /wait Albwir.MC.CamDxf.Forvet.exe -BATCH`
