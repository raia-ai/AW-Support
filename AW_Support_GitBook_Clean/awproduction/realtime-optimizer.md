# A+W Production Packing Optimization - Software Reference

## Menus

### Section B

Section B shows the weight distribution in kg, per rack and per side.

**Fig. 1-64: Weight in kg**
`383 (183+200) Kg`

For the image above, this means: The total rack weight is 383 kg. The values in brackets show the weight per rack side, i.e. 183 kg for side 1 and 200 kg for side 2.

### Section C

Section C shows the load distribution in % for the right and left side of the rack.

**Fig. 1-65: Weight in %**
`51% 49%`

For the image above, this means: 51 % of the load are on the left and 49 % on the right. The percentage also considers the weight of units on the outside as compared with units on the inside. This may result in distinctive differences in the load distribution (such as 30 % vs. 70 %).

## Basic Ideas

A major potential for saving in flat glass processing is the optimal use of the stockplates at cutting. The smaller the waste or the residual plates, the greater is the use of material, and the lower the material cost. Controlling cutting tables with optimized cutting plans directly from the optimization speeds up the work process.

A+W Production is based on two fundamental ideas:
- Cutting optimization for the linked cutting table
- Transfer of cutting codes to the linked cutting table

*Fig. J-1: A screenshot showing the cutting optimization and cutting table control interface.*

### Features

A+W Production supports these fundamental ideas with the following features:
- A+W Production controls cutting by means of optimized detailed scheduling data.
- Rush orders, rejects or filler sizes can be automatically re-optimized in a residual plate.
- Cutting tables are controlled mainly online by means of communication logs supported by the table manufacturers.
- Rush order lites, rejects, and fillers are optimized directly at the cutting table.
- Existing optimizations can be checked with regard to table optimization, to be resolved and reassembled if required. By adding rejects, filler sizes and rush order lites, bigger optimizations can be created. Defined sequences on A racks are maintained.
- Even at the detailed scheduling stage, A+W Production allows optimizing the cutting of every batch on the scheduled cutting table.
- A+W Production is especially configured for a cutting table, and can transfer the scheduled and optimized batches to this cutting table, together with the cutting code.
- Once the appropriate cutting code has been transferred to the cutting table, the breakout pattern can be displayed via XTV.

## Using A+W Production

This subject area introduces the functions of A+W Production.
This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Import of data
- Working with A+W Production
- Use as a stand-alone system

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding import of data
- Getting to know and understanding the connection to A+W Production.
- Getting to know and understanding the operation as stand-alone system

**Benefit**
The data has to be imported correctly before working with A+W Production.

**Definitions**
- **Pre-systems**: These systems supply orders (batches) containing master data and cutting optimizations.
- **Stand-alone variant**: The stand-alone system imports the data by means of save files which must be provided in a special directory.
- **Residual stock**: The residual stock manages residual plates at the cutting table.

**Note**
- **A+W Production**: Can be adapted to all common cutting tables.
- **Stand-alone variant**: The A+W Production can be used stand-alone.
- **Connection**: The staff of A+W configure the import of data.

### Import of data

Depending on the basic system, data is imported fully or semi-automatically. These systems supply A+W Production with orders (batches) containing master data and cutting optimizations.

*Fig. J-2: A diagram showing an overview of the work with A+W Production. Batches are fed into the A+W Realtime Optimizer, which handles optimization and cutting code creation, interacts with a database, and controls the cutting table.*

A multitude of possible configurations open up the following possibilities in connection with A+W Production:
- Integrated into an A+W Production or an A+W Business Pro environment.
- Adapting to all common cutting tables
- Link to a residual stock
- Use as a stand-alone system

The system is configured and installed by A+W staff.

Possible basic systems are:
- A+W Production
- A+W Business Pro

> **Linking to the basic system**
> The staff of A+W configure the basic system and the import of data.

*Fig. J-3: A diagram showing data import in A+W Production. Import files are processed by the A+W Realtime Optimizer, which checks and imports data into the A+W Production database containing batches, master data, articles, glass types, tables, and optimization parameters.*

If A+W Production works with A+W Production, A+W Production uses the A+W Production database as well. If another system is used, A+W Production needs an empty A+W Production database. Master data and optimizations included in the batches of the basic system will be adopted by A+W Production into the empty A+W Production database. Data is checked at the same time.

The system rejects data that causes errors during import. The error log shows why the individual records were rejected. The data can be processed further.

#### Working with A+W Production

When A+W Production is linked to an existing A+W Production system, data is exchanged automatically. Master data, batches, rejects, rush and filler orders are directly loaded from the A+W Production database. Apart from that, status reports for the individual batches are saved in the database.

#### Master data

If the access to master data was released at configuration, these can be viewed and processed.

Master data includes:
- Articles
- Glass Types
- Tables
- Optimization parameters
- Stockplates

Master data and their use are described in the Detailed Scheduling section of the A+W Production user manual.

#### Use as a stand-alone system

A+W Production is installed with an empty A+W Production database. When batches are imported, the database is filled with master data.

The stand-alone system imports the data by means of save files, which must be provided to A+W Production in a special directory. Save files have to stick to a defined structure and are usually available in the working directory `.\Xopton\im-port\work\*save.*`. Imported data is removed from the working directory, and transferred to archives.

#### Import optimizations

The Import optimizations function is only required and valid for A+W Production stand-alone versions.
A+W Production can supply a cutting table with cutting data or create table optimizations if batches are provided by another system. If batches are supplied, A+W Production can import them for further processing.

The following steps can be performed in connection with the import of batches:
- Switch on import.
- Switch off import.
- React to error reports.

**Switch on import**
1.  Open the Import dialog. Select `View > Import`.
2.  Use the [Start] button to start the import.
    A+W Production checks the working directory for import files. If import files are found, the data are imported into the database while the import files are transferred to archives.
    Imported batches are available for further processing on the `Select a batch` and `Select glass for optimization` dialogs.
    Button [Start] becomes [Stop].
3.  Close the dialog. Click the [Close] button.

A+W Production monitors the working directory until the import function is switched off.
Should errors occur during import, these are recorded; and the batches in question will not be imported. Errors can be processed manually.

**Switch off import**
1.  Open the Import dialog. As long as import is switched on, a minimized dialog is shown in the bottom left corner of the A+W Production dialog.
2.  Use the [Stop] button to terminate import.
    Import files just stored in the working directory remain there, unprocessed.
    Button [Stop] changes into [Start].
3.  Close the dialog. Click the [Close] button.

**React to error reports**
Should errors occur during import, these are recorded; and the batches in question will not be imported.
Import is stopped only if there is an imminent loss of data. This may be the case if an existing optimization should be overridden. Depending on the configuration, an error message appears.
1.  Answer the question in the error report dialog xopt-on. Select the appropriate button, [Yes] or [No]. Import of data is resumed.
2.  Open Error messages dialog. Select `View > Error reports` menu.
3.  Check the error messages and respond accordingly.

## Input

This section tells you how to handle the input.
This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Rejects, rush order lites or filler orders
- Manual creation of plans
- Charge editor

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding rejects.
- Getting to know and understanding rush order lites.
- Getting to know and understanding filler orders.

**Benefit**
By using rejects, rush order lites and filler orders you can improve the yield.

**Definitions**
- **Reject**: A lite broken during cutting.
- **Rush order lite**: A lite, that must be cut quickly
- **Filler order**: Serves to use capacities and material efficiently.

**Note**
- **Rejects**: Rejects can be entered manually via A+W Production, or at another place within a networked production.
- **Rush order lites**: Rush order lites are created by A+W Production and are saved in the database.
- **Filler orders**: Filler orders can be used only if A+W Production is used together with AWP.

### Rejects, rush order lites or filler orders

Rejects can be entered manually via A+W Production, or at another place within a networked production. Depending on the configuration, rejects are shown directly in the A+W Production rejects pool. At the next opportunity, the broken lites are optimized automatically with the residual plate, or (depending on the configuration) integrated manually into a table optimization.

Rush order lites are created by A+W Production and are saved in the database. Rush orders can be integrated in the next table optimization with a suitable glass type and thickness.

Filler orders can be used only if A+W Production is used together with A+W Production. In this case, filler orders are directly taken from the A+W Production database.

*Fig. J-4: A diagram showing input and processing of data in A+W Production. Rush order lites, Breakage, and Filler are fed into the Realtime Optimizer to create table optimizations, which interacts with the A+W Production database.*

### Manual entry of lites

In addition to batches from another system, A+W Production allows to enter lites, add them to table optimizations, and transfer them to the cutting table.

Use the following steps to enter or delete lites manually:
- Enter rush order lites.
- Editing rush order lites.
- Delete rush order lites.
- Enter rejects.
- Delete rejects.

### Manual creation of plans

This option allows you to create a purely manual plan and save it as table optimization in the database. The manual plan can be edited and changed afterwards. This is done by means of the A+W PlanEdit module. For details on this module, please refer to the corresponding documentation. No barcode information will be available for manual plans.

**How to create a new plan**
1.  Select menu `Input > Manual Plan`. The **Manual Plan Input Cutting Table ...** dialog opens.
2.  In section **Glass Types** select the glass type you want to create the plan for.
3.  On the left select the stock dimension in the **Stockplates** section that should be used for the manual cutting pattern.
4.  In section **Residue Plates** define height and width for the residual plate to be created.
5.  Click the [New] icon. A+W PlanEditor opens.
6.  Enter the requested lites via the context menu. Thus, select the **Insert** option and enter the specific lite data.
7.  Via `File > Save as` it is possible to save the cutting plan as file.
8.  Use `Output > AWC` for transfer to cutting.

**How to edit a manual plan**
1.  To edit a manually entered cutting plan, select `Input > Manual Plan` from the menu. The **Manual Plan Input Cutting Table ...** dialog opens. The lower section **Plan** shows the plan previously entered.
2.  Use the [Edit] button to open the plan, previously entered and make the modifications.
3.  Don't forget to save the modifications or to release the data via `Output > AWC`.

**How to select a plan manually entered for cutting**
1.  A plan entered manually can only be cut directly via **Cutting**.
2.  Use the [Cutting] button to select all batches optimized and prepared for cutting.
3.  The manually created plan appears in the list of available batches with batch number >15000 and has the additional information **PlanEdit**.
4.  Select the batch and prepare it for cutting ([Options] button) or cut it directly ([Cutting] button).

> **Additional information**
> - Software Reference, "Manual creation of plans" on page J-1196

### Charge editor

Via this dialog it is possible to define a charge number. Tag the checkbox and the entered charge number will be inherited to the following stockplates of the same glass type/thickness. The last charge number is saved per glass type/thickness/stockplate. Next time, this editor will be opened the input field will be preset with this value. The allocation always affects the selected stock dimension (and in case of inheritance those below).

A set charge (including inheritance) can also be deleted via this editor.

If the cutting process for a stock dimension has no batch allocation, the user has to enter a charge number first. The Charge Editor dialog appears with a corresponding info in A+W Production Terminal (XTV).

> **Additional information**
> - Software Reference, "Charge editor" on page J-1199

## Optimization

This section shows you how the optimization works.
This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Cutting table optimizations
- Create a quick optimization
- Linking of batches
- Cutting table control

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding table optimizations
- Getting to know and understanding quick optimizations
- Getting to know and understanding linking of residual plates
- Getting to know and understanding cutting table control

**Benefit**
The more efficiently the optimization works, the higher the yield. This saves money.

**Definitions**
- **Cutting table optimizations**: Optimizations, created with A+W Production.
- **Quick optimization**: Plates, not sent yet to the cutting table can be resolved completely and re-optimized.

**Note**
- **Batch**: A batch is a composition of glass from one or more orders, to be considered and produced at once in optimization and production (e.g., same route, same customer, same glass types, same production dates). The optimizations of prior systems exist in the shape of batches.
- **Lot**: A part / a glass type of a batch, that should be processed / cut under identical conditions at the same time (e.g. all Float 4 of a batch).
- **Cutting table control**: The cutting table to be controlled by A+W Production is defined during installation.
- **Rejects**: Can either be cut in the re-optimization at the end of a batch to be cut or transferred to rejects pool and can be cut together with the next batch.

### Cutting table optimizations

Table optimizations are optimizations created by A+W Production. Upstream systems provide complete optimizations that are resolved by A+W Production to be rearranged. You can combine any number of batches, provided there is enough space for the racks at the cutting table.

When you create table optimizations, you can take into account residual plates on the cutting table, use different stockplates, or use a residual stock. Rejects, rush or filler orders can be excluded or integrated as required.

Table optimizations are saved in the database, and are used for cutting if required.

#### Create table optimizations

The following steps are necessary when creating a new table optimization:
- Select glass type and batch for table optimization.
- Create table optimization.

**Select glass type and batch for table optimization**
1.  Open the dialog **Select glass for optimization**. Select `Optimization > Table Optimization`.
2.  From the **Glass type** list, select the glass type to be optimized. The **Glass type** list shows if special orders (reject, rush order lites, etc.) exist in A+W Production for the glass type.
    - If you select a glass type for which there are broken lites or rush order lites, these will be automatically integrated in the new table optimization (if configured).
    - If your system is configured to work with residual plate storage, this list shows whether a residual plate is available for the glass type in question.
    - The **Available optimizations** list shows all batches containing optimizations for the glass type and thickness selected from the **Glass type** list.
3.  Tag the **Permit manual cutting** checkbox to show even glass types that are only meant to be cut manually.
4.  From the list **Available optimizations** select the batches to be arranged in a table optimization.
    > **Select only rejects and rush order lites**
    > If there are broken lites or rush order lites for the selected glass type, these lites can be optimized without another batch. Do not select a batch from the list in this case.
    > If you have tagged a batch but do not want to select it, change the selected glass type. When you select the required glass type again, no batch will be tagged.
5.  Click [Select] to compile the selected batches in a table optimization.
The dialog closes. Dialog **Table optimization** appears in which the tab **Optimize** shows the selected batches.

**Create table optimization**
1.  Please make sure that in the previous step, **Select batches for table optimization**, batches have been actually selected. Dialog **Table optimization** appears with the tab **Optimize**.
2.  Select the necessary optimization parameters.
3.  Select the required parameter from tab **Stockplates**.
4.  Select the required parameters from tab **Filler**.
5.  To create the optimization, return to tab **Optimize** and click the [Optimize] button. The calculation of the optimization starts, the dialog disappears, and the optimization is run in the background. As long as the optimization is running, you can go on working with A+W Production. As soon as the optimization result is available, the dialog reappears automatically. The optimization result is shown on the **Overview** tab.
6.  To save the optimization, click [Save].
The optimization is now shown on the **Select a batch** dialog and can be transferred to the cutting table.

> - Software Reference, "Optimize" on page J-1210
> - Software Reference, "Residue plates and stockplates" on page J-1212
> - "Selecting batches for cutting" on page J-1137

### Check and process table optimization result

Table optimizations can be checked anytime before they are transferred to the cutting table. To change a table optimization, to add reject, rush order lites, or filler sizes, or to add or delete whole jobs, you need to resolve the entire optimization, and create a new one.

The following steps are possible when creating a table optimization:
- Select other stockplates for optimization.
- Use residual plate from previous optimization.
- Add filler sizes to the optimization.

Changes are impossible once a table optimization was saved.

**Select other stockplates for optimization**
1.  From dialog **Table optimization**, select tab **Stockplates**. The list on the right side shows all stockplates defined in master data for this glass type and thickness, which are available for cutting.
2.  Tag the stockplate(s) A+W Production may use for cutting optimization. During optimization A+W Production checks how many lites of which size are needed to achieve the optimum result.
3.  To create the optimization, switch to the tab **Optimize** and click the [Start] button.
4.  To save the optimization, click [Save].

**Use residual plate from previous optimization**
1.  From dialog **Table optimization**, select tab **Stockplates**. If there is a residual plate of the same glass type and thickness on the cutting table as required in the present optimization, this can be integrated in the table optimization.
2.  Enter the height and width of the residual plate on the cutting table in section **Residual plate**.
3.  To create the optimization, switch to the tab **Optimize** and click the [Start] button.
4.  To save the optimization, click [Save].

**Add filler sizes to the optimization**
1.  From dialog **Table optimization**, select tab **Filler**. The list on the right shows all filler orders defined for the glass type and thickness of this batch.
2.  Tag the filler orders to be integrated into the table optimization. Ideally, filler orders are used to minimize the waste, or the residual plate.
3.  To create the optimization, go to tab **Optimize** and click [Optimize].
4.  Continue to add or delete filler orders until the optimum result is reached.
5.  To save the optimization, click [Save].

> **Additional information**
> - "Resolve table optimization" on page J-1129

### Resolve table optimization

Table optimizations can be resolved only if they were saved after having been created. As long as **Table optimization** dialog is open and the table optimization in question has not been saved, the optimization can be rejected by pressing the Cancel button.

When you resolve a table optimization, the batches included are returned to the batch list. Possibly included breakage, rush order lites, or filler orders are returned to the appropriate pools, and are available again for new optimizations.

Optimizations for which cutting was started and cancelled, can also be resolved. Batches for which lites were cut already are reset and treated as if cutting had not taken place.

**Resolve created and saved table optimizations**
1.  Open the dialog **Reset cutting batch**. This is done in menu `Optimization > Reset`. The **Reset a cutting batch** dialog shows a list of all batches available for status changes. The list is sorted by batch numbers. Table optimizations are shown as batches with numbers starting from 15000 (can be configured).
2.  Tag the table optimization you want to break down. Tag the corresponding batch with a number higher than 15000. You can tag several table optimizations to be resolved at the same time.
3.  To save the optimization, click the [OK] button. A security query appears.
4.  Confirm this query. Select the [Yes] button.
The batches and lites of the selected table optimization are now available for new table optimizations. If the table optimization was using ReMaster lites, these are available again after the optimization was resolved.

### Linking of table optimizations

To improve the waste it is possible to link table optimizations. Linking is only possible for table optimizations with the same glass types, which means that the table optimizations must exist.

To link table optimizations the following steps are required:
- Select glass type and batch for table optimization.
- Create table optimization.

**Linking of table optimizations**
1.  Open the dialog **Select glass for optimization**. Select `Optimization > Table optimization`.
2.  From the **Glass type** list, select the glass type to be optimized. The **Glass type** list shows if special orders (rejects, rush order lites, etc.) exist in A+W Production for the glass type. If you select a glass type for which there are broken lites or rush order lites, these will be automatically integrated in the new table optimization (if configured). If your system is configured to work with residual storage, this list shows whether a residual plate is available for the glass type in question. The list **Available optimizations** shows all batches containing optimizations for the glass type and thickness selected from the list **Glass type**.
3.  Tag the checkbox **Permit manual cutting** to show even glass types that are only meant to be cut manually.
4.  From the list **Available optimizations** select the batches to be arranged in a table optimization.

> **Additional information**
> - "Linking of table optimizations" on page J-1131

### Create a quick optimization

Plates / patterns already optimized (via A+W Production or via Table optimization in A+W Realtime Optimizer), but still not sent to the table, can be resolved completely and re-optimized. Thus, rush order lites and rejects will also be optimized and a completely new cutting pattern is the result for the re-optimized plates.

The following steps are necessary when creating a quick optimization:
- Create table optimization.
- Cutting of table optimization has been started

In case of reject during cutting, this can be re-cut in real-time by using the quick optimization.

*Fig. J-5: A screenshot showing the Cutting overview.*

Via the context menu it is possible to resolve the optimization from the next pattern on and to re-optimize.

In example Fig. J-5 (Cutting overview) the patterns / plates 1 and 2 were sent to table and cut. The plates / patterns 3-6 can be resolved and re-optimized (quick optimizations) via right click.

*Fig. J-6: A context menu showing "Resolve and re-optimize optimization 1004 lot 1 from pattern 7 on."*

After confirming the message the plates still to be cut will be removed. Then, the broken lites and the plates still to be cut will be re-optimized.

> **Additional information**
> - "Cutting overview" on page J-1143

### Linking of batches

With the linking of batches, A+W allows you to avoid residual plates. In the past, residual plates had to be assembled manually. This is no longer necessary.

Linking takes place during cutting and is synchronized with it.

**Batch: #** dialog activates the option for linking batches in section **Residual plate management**.

When cutting is started, the system will send the first pattern of a batch then search - starting from the next batch- the database for a suitable batch of this glass type; the corresponding data will be loaded.

The next batch must have the status **Released**. The batch is loaded in the background so as not to interrupt cutting. When the penultimate lite (can be configured) of a glass type has been cut, the user will be informed (optionally!) as to which batch and lot the residual plate will be linked to. The user can abort the linking at this point or choose a corresponding lot.

When the user confirms this link, rush order lites and rejects of this glass type will be loaded, and added to the next optimization with priority 0. The residual plate of the currently cut batch becomes the start plate of the next optimization. Then optimization is started. After the optimization, the next optimization will be linked with the original optimization so that the residual plate of the original optimization will be filled with the lites of the first plate of the next optimization. All other patterns of the next optimization will be resolved in the last cut optimization. The system now creates and transfers a new cutting code.

The first pattern of the next optimization is market **Cut**. Using the mechanism from the table optimization, the next optimization is first saved as a table optimization, after which the batch and batch number of the original, next optimization are added. The status of the next optimization is changed to **Started**.

### Cutting table control

A+W Production works as a cutting control station.

> **Parameters of the linked table**
> The cutting table to be controlled by A+W Production is defined during installation. The corresponding parameters are defined at installation. Optimizations are created with the parameters set in A+W Production or A+W Production.

A cutting code is created and transferred to the cutting table, or is made available in a defined directory. Depending on the cutting table and the table control, the cutting table is transferred to the table by a special program, or is loaded from the defined directory by the cutting table software.

*Fig. J-7: A diagram showing input and processing of data in A+W Production. The Realtime Optimizer (handling cutting code creation, re-optimization, and status management) interacts with the Production Database and sends data to the Cutting table.*

Once the cutting code for a stockplate was sent to the cutting table, A+W Production considers this stockplate completed. If transfer of the cutting code is interrupted, work can be resumed at this precise spot.

In connection with XTV, breakage at the cutting table is directly reported to A+W Production. As long as the cutting code for the last stockplate of a glass type (a batch) has not been transferred to the cutting table, breakage can be automatically re-optimized, to be cut with the last stockplate of the batch.

## Cutting

This section tells you how to handle the cutting.
This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Selecting batches for cutting
- Check optimization and cut
- Interrupt and continue work
- Cutting overview

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding the cutting process.

**Benefit**
A+W Production can be used to the best effect only if you are capable of the process.

**Definition**
- **Panorama**: Part of the program that can be configured to control complex machines or more machines (cutting lines).

**Note**
- **Batch number 1000-9999**: Come from a prior system.
- **Batch number from 15000**: Batches starting from number 15000 contain table optimizations created by A+W Production. The number range can be configured.
- **Panorama**: Administration of Panorama is password-protected.

### Selecting batches for cutting

Optimizations exist in the form of batches. Select the batches containing the optimizations you want to cut on the cutting table.

**Selecting batches for cutting**
1.  Open dialog **Select a batch**. Select menu `Cutting > Cutting optimization`.
2.  Select a batch. Select an entry in the **Batch** list. The **Optimisation** list shows the optimizations existing for this batch.
    > **Batch numbers**
    > Batches with the numbers 1000-9999 come from an upstream system and contain one or more optimizations. Batches starting from number 15000 contain table optimizations created by A+W Production.
3.  Select one or all optimizations. If no optimization is tagged, the system assumes that all to be selected. You can configure whether individual optimizations can be selected.
    > **Optimization numbers**
    > Optimizations are defined per lot (per glass type), and numbered consecutively for every batch.
4.  Click [OK]. The tagged optimizations are selected for cutting and shown in dialog **Batch [number -] - batch [number]**.
5.  Close the dialog. Click the [OK] button.
6.  Start the cutting process. Click the [START] button.

**Re-cut already cut batches**
When all plates of an optimization have been cut, the entire batch gets the status **Produced**. This status can be reset to status **Released**, and the entire batch can be cut again.
1.  Open the dialog **Reset cutting batch**. This is done in menu `Optimization > Reset`. The **Reset a cutting batch** dialog shows a list of all batches available for status changes. The list is sorted by batch numbers. Completely cut batches are shown with status **Produced**.
2.  Select the batch you want to reset from status **Produced** to status **Released**. You can tag several jobs, and reset them together.
3.  Click the [OK] button to reset the batch. The batch is now available again for cutting as a complete optimization.

**Skip pattern**
If you choose **Skip pattern** for a lite, no cutting code will be created, and no breakout pattern will be shown for this lite.
1.  Open dialog **Residual plate handling**. Click the button [Options] in dialog **Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]** for the batch you want to edit.
2.  Tag in the **Optimizations** list the glass type for which individual stockplates should be cut again. The **Lites** list shows all lites for a batch belonging to the selected glass type. The **Status** column shows the status of each stockplate. You can skip only lites with a status other than **Cut**.
3.  Click the right mouse key on the lite to be skipped during cutting. A context menu appears with the entries **Skip pattern**, and **Do not send cutting code**.
4.  Select **Skip pattern** to stop the system from creating a cutting code and a breakout pattern for this lite.
5.  Close the dialog. Click the [OK] button.

**Suppress cutting code creation**
If you select **Do not send cutting code** for a lite, the system will create no cutting code, but the breakout pattern will be shown in A+W Production Terminal (XTV).
1.  Open dialog **Residual plate handling**. Click the button [Options] in dialog **Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]** for the batch you want to edit.
2.  Tag in the **Optimizations** list the glass type for which individual stockplates should be cut again. The **Lites** list shows all lites for a batch belonging to the selected glass type. The **Status** column shows the status of each stockplate. You can send no cutting code only for lites with a status other than **Cut**.
3.  Click the right mouse key on the lite to be skipped during cutting. A context menu appears with the entries **Skip pattern**, and **Do not send cutting code**.
4.  Select **Do not send cutting code** to stop the system from creating a cutting code for this lite, but show the breakout pattern in A+W Production Terminal (XTV).
5.  Close the dialog. Click the [OK] button.

### Check optimization and cut

Once you have selected optimizations for cutting, you can run some checks, then transfer the optimizations to the cutting table.

This chapter describes the following steps:
- Show scheduled cutting sequence.
- Check residual plates.
- Define start of cutting and start cutting.

The following descriptions are based on the assumption that you have completed the previous step **Selecting batches for cutting** and that the **Batch [Number] - Batch [Number]** dialog is displayed.

**Show scheduled cutting sequence**
1.  Click the button [Sequence]. Dialog **Cutting sequence** appears.
    > **Sequence in case of several batches**
    > If several batches have been selected for cutting, the stockplates will be sorted acc. to the configuration of A+W Production. All residual plates can be cut at the end of the batch for example, or at the end of a glass type. A+W Production can be configured to cut stockplates alternately (e.g. coated - uncoated).
2.  Click [OK] to close the dialog.

**Check residual plates**
1.  Click the button [Residual plates]. Dialog **Residual plate handling** appears.
2.  Check the displayed values.
3.  Amend the status of individual plates, or the settings for reject handling if necessary.
4.  If the PlanEdit module is installed on your workstation, you can view the cutting pattern for the selected stockplate by using the button **Process pattern**.
5.  Click [OK] to close the dialog.

**Define start of cutting and start cutting**
1.  In the **Optimizations** list, tag the lot from where cutting should start.
2.  From the **Pattern** list, select the stockplate from where cutting should start.
3.  Click the [START] button.
    The system creates the cutting code for the optimizations displayed, and transfers it to the connected cutting table.
    Wording and function of the button changes into [STOP].
    If A+W Production works with A+W Production Terminal (XTV), the A+W Production Terminal (XTV) breakout pattern can be controlled by the keys [Stop] and [<<].

> - Software Reference, "Batch [number] - batch [number]" on page J-1230

### Interrupt and continue work

An optimization that cuts the stockplates in succession can be interrupted due to technical interferences or the end of a shift. A+W Production marks the point at which the work was interrupted and allows you to go on from there.

The following steps are described below:
- Interrupt cutting during an optimization.
- Continue cutting after an interruption.

**Interrupt cutting during an optimization**
1.  You are in dialog **Cutting overview**.
2.  Click the [STOP] button.
3.  Close the dialog.

**Continue cutting after an interruption**
A+W Production remembers optimizations that have not been cut completely.
1.  Select menu `Cutting > Cut optimization` to select an optimization for cutting. A security query appears. The system shows the incomplete batch and asks whether this should be completed.
2.  To view the interrupted batch, select [Yes]. A+W Production shows the interrupted batch in dialog **Batch [number] - batch [number]**. If you answer the security query with **No**, the interrupted optimization will be set to **Started**. Already transferred cutting patterns remain on status **Cut**. The **Select a batch** dialog appears.
3.  To continue the interrupted cutting, click [Start]. The cutting code of the already cut lites is not transferred to the cutting table again.

### Cutting overview

The cutting overview shows the glass to be cut next.

*Fig. J-8: Screenshot of the cutting overview dialog, broken down into A (Menu), B (Plate view), and C (Lite view).*

- To show or hide the menu (A) on the left side of the dialog press the respective icon.

- Via the context menu, you can set stop codes for particular elements and reset them again. Mark the appropriate element and open the context menu. Then select the **Stop** entry.

*Fig. J-11: A context menu with a "Stop" option checked.*

- You can cancel the stop code by deactivating the **Stop** entry again.
> **Stop code**
> Stop codes that are set on the cutting dialog are not saved in the Ope2Out exchange file. This means that they are not saved if the cutting dialog is closed and that they are not visible on the Options before cutting dialog.

### Reset cutting status

If a batch or individual stockplates has already reached the status **Cut** but should be cut again, the production status can be reset, and cutting can be repeated.

The production status can be reset with the following steps:
- Re-cut already cut lites.
- Re-cut already cut batches.

If the whole optimization was reset, but only individual stockplates should be cut again, you can exclude parts of the optimization from being cut again by:
- Skip pattern.
- Suppress cutting code creation.

**Re-cut already cut lites**
Individual lites or whole batches can be cut again as long as A+W Production can still access the batches. Cutting of the corresponding batch has to be selected and displayed in the **Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]** dialog.
1.  Open dialog **Residual plate handling**. Click the button [Residual plates] in dialog **Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]** for the corresponding batch.
2.  Tag in the **Optimizations** list the glass type for which a stockplate should be cut again. The **Lites** list shows all lites for a batch belonging to the selected glass type. The **Status** column shows the status of each stockplate.
    - Software Reference, "Batch: Number" on page J-1233
3.  Click the right mouse key on the lites you want to reset from status **Cut** to be cut again. A context menu appears showing the entry **Cut**.

- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W Pattern Viewer.
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W PlanEditor.
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W Continuous Cutting.
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W Defect Optimizer.

**Benefit**
The performance of A+W Production can be increased by adapting other modules.

**Definitions**
- **A+W Residual Stock Manager**: The residual stock storage manages residual plates at the cutting table.
- **A+W Pattern Viewer**: Offers a breakout display at the cutting table.
- **A+W PlanEditor**: Shows the data of patterns to be cut, tabulated and graphically.
- **A+W Continuous Cutting**: Controls from the office what is cut so that the operators know automatically what they have to do.
- **A+W Defect Optimizer**: The intelligent defect optimization
- **A+W DynOpt Compact**: A+W entry level solution for dynamic optimization

**Note**
- **Configuration**: A+W Production can be configured to work with different modules.

### Overview

A+W Production can be configured to work with different modules. For information on linking with different basic systems please refer to the previous chapter.

If A+W Production was configured accordingly, it can work with the following modules:
- A+W Residual Stock Manager
- A+W Pattern Viewer
- A+W PlanEditor
- A+W Continuous Cutting
- A+W Defect Optimizer
- A+W DynOpt Compact

### A+W Residual Stock Manager

This module is a residual stock storage system in which residual plates are managed on the cutting table. If during cutting there is a residual plate, it is not discarded, but saved temporarily in the A+W Residual Stock Manager. Information on glass type, thickness, and dimensions of the residual plates are entered and saved in a management program (A+W Planning Web). A+W Production can work with the A+W Planning Web. Here, data about the residual plates is exchanged. Residual plates can then be integrated by A+W Production into table optimizations. If an optimization is cut, the residual plate can be replaced by a plate from the residual stock (without re-optimization).

As soon as a residual plate is planned into an optimization, A+W Production informs the A+W Planning Web about this status. The residual plate can then no longer be used for other cuts.

If a table is controlled with a cutting code that was optimized for a residual plate, the cutting code controls the residual plate storage, and the required residual plate is put onto the table for cutting.

### A+W Pattern Viewer

The A+W Pattern Viewer provides a breakout display at the cutting table, which, depending on the configuration, can be used to enter breakage. A+W Production provides the information to the A+W Pattern Viewer, once the cutting code for the connected table has been created. The A+W Pattern Viewer can then show the breakout pattern for this optimization. The display matches the stockplate or residual plate to be cut and provides all essential information on the optimization, the article, and the individual lites. If A+W Pattern Viewer is used to enter breakage, the module provides appropriate information to A+W Production.

#### Settings

You can reach the Settings via the A+W logo:

The blue triangle at the upper edge in the A+W Pattern Viewer indicates where the linked batch begins.
*Fig. J-46: A screenshot showing the beginning of a linked batch, indicated by a blue triangle.*

#### Display setting edge

If for a free shape a marking for the setting edge was stored in the SN file (e.g., in the order entry with iTOE), this edge is indicated in the A+W Pattern Viewer with a yellow arrow.
*Fig. J-47: A screenshot showing the setting edge for free shapes, indicated by a yellow arrow.*

> **Display setting edge**
> By adding the activity `HideStandingEdge`, the display of the setting edge (triangle) is removed for all lites.

#### Display symbol for processings, stamp, logo or reference mark

The A+W Pattern Viewer also provides the ability to display an image instead of a stamp or a logo.
> **Symbols**
> The symbols depend on the customer and configuration. They will be set up accordingly by A+W employees during installation. If you want to make changes to your configuration (e.g., display a logo or stamp), please contact an A+W employee.

#### Color selection for order items

The A+W Pattern Viewer also offers the opportunity to color glass in a user-defined color. There are various colors available for selection.
> **Colors**
> The selection of colors is based on the desires of the individual customer. They will be set up accordingly by A+W employees during installation.

#### Mark the first and last lite

The A+W Pattern Viewer offers the opportunity to mark the first and last lites in a storage location accordingly.
> **Marking the first and last lite**
> Whether the first and last lites in a storage location are marked is based on the desires of the individual customer. This will be set up accordingly by A+W employees during installation.

#### Size

If you click **Measurements**, the **Unit System** area opens:
*Fig. J-48: The Measurements menu with options for Unit System (Metric/Imperial) and Decimal Places/Precision.*

In the **Unit System** entry, you can select between:

The combo box below depends on the selection of the unit system. If you have selected **Metric**, you can use the **Decimal Places** combo box to decide how many decimal places (up to three) should be displayed. If you have selected **Imperial**, you can use the **Precision** combo box to select this (1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, 1/256).

#### Rejects

In the A+W Pattern Viewer you can mark lites as broken by marking the appropriate lite on the breakage display. There is a selection with all breakage reasons created. Select the appropriate breakage reason. The selection is closed and the selected lite marked accordingly.

### A+W PlanEditor

The A+W PlanEditor shows the data of patterns to be cut, as a table and graphically. The results show the statistical evaluation of the existing patterns. You get a quick overview of the lites to be produced, stock dimensions, residual plates, waste, etc.

Depending on the configuration, the graphics editor shows the patterns to be cut, and offers various ways of processing. You can create and change patterns, add lites, save and print the pattern.

If the A+W PlanEditor is installed on your workstation, you can start the A+W PlanEditor by double-clicking on an optimized plate after creating a table optimization. It then shows the cutting pattern for this plate. Changes that you make to such a pattern with the A+W Plan Editor are taken over into A+W Production.

> **Additional Information**
> For more information on A+W PlanEditor please refer to the appropriate documentation.

### A+W Continuous Cutting

If the A+W Production on the cutting table is running in **Continuous Cutting** mode, an overview of the batches planned for this table is displayed before the start of cutting. Here it is possible to reset a batch if necessary. If you continue cutting, the first group in the cutting is loaded and cutting is started. If there is a rush group, it is loaded first and the subsequent group is attached. When the last batch of the current group has almost been cut, the next group is loaded into cutting automatically. This way, all planned batches are gradually processed automatically according to the settings made in planning.

#### Overview of the planned batches

In the planning view in AWP, all batches optimized and released for cutting are displayed with their properties. Here, you can now select which batches should be cut on the cutting table for which they were optimized. Here, the sequence can be specified and various settings made. For batches already planned, it is possible to make changes, assuming that the cutting has not yet begun.

If you click `Cutting > Continuous Cutting ...` in the A+W Production, a list appears with the released batches:

*Fig. J-49: A screenshot of the Released Lots dialog.*

With the **Cutting Tables** combo box, you can restrict the display if necessary. Click the [Planning F5] button at the lower right to open the planning view:

*Fig. J-50: A screenshot of the main Planning view.*

**Description of fields**

**Filters**
For a better overview, filters can be applied in order to filter the batches displayed by glass types, for example. The corresponding settings are in `AWP > Configuration > Parameters > A+W Production > Continuous Cutting > AUW_CONTINUOUS_CUTTING > Filters`.

*Fig. J-51: Parameter Administrator window showing filter settings.*

To create a new filter or make changes to an existing filter, please click the three dots. A dialog opens:

*Fig. J-52: Dialog for creating or changing a filter.*

To make changes to an existing filter, mark the filter in question and click the [Edit] button. To create a new filter, click the [New] button. The **Create/edit Filter** dialog opens.

*Fig. J-53: Dialog for editing an existing filter.*

Give the filter a meaningful name and make sure the syntax of the filter is correct. You can define a permanent filter, e.g. `pool_teile.glasart = 1004` or a filter with one or two placeholders, e.g. `pool_teile.glasart = [TTV1NUM]`. For filters with placeholders, the user enters the desired value himself later on.

**Production date**
If a time span is specified here, only batches are displayed whose production date is in this time span.

**Re-optimization**
Here the mode for the re-optimization and the quantity of broken lites from which this should be triggered is specified.

**Rush optimization**
Here you specify whether a rush optimization should be executed for the batch if a particular quantity of broken lites has been reached.

**Residual plate management**
Here you specify whether in which mode the residual plate should be linked.

**Editing a residual plate**
Here you specify whether the residual plate can be processed and starting at which length.

**Grouping**
Several batches can be combined into a group. Batches of the same group will be sent together to the cutting table in cutting in A+W Production. If cutting has begun for a group in cutting, no batch in this group may be changed. A batch must be assigned to a group in order to be released for cutting.

**Here's how to create a group for a batch**
1.  Select the appropriate table.
2.  Mark the desired batches.
3.  Click the [Group] button.
4.  Click the [Release] button.
5.  The group is created and attached behind the already-released batches.

**Here's how to move a group for a batch**
The sequence of released lots not yet begun can be changed
1.  Select the appropriate group.
2.  Move the selected group to the desired position with the arrow keys.
3.  Click the [Release] button.
4.  The group is moved to the desired location.

**Here's how to resolve a group**
1.  Mark the desired lots in a group.
2.  Click the [Reset] button.
3.  Click the [Release] button.
4.  The group is resolved.

**Rush groups**
Rush groups include batches that are handled with priority.

**Here's how to create a rush group**
1.  Select the desired batches.
2.  Click the [Rush group] button.
3.  Click the [Release] button. If the rush group is not in the desired position, you can use the arrow keys to move it to the desired position (as long as cutting has not yet begun).

**Resetting batches**
Already planned batches and settings can be reset so that they are not cut automatically.

#### Cutting

On the A+W Production menu, click `Settings > Cutting`. This dialog opens:

*Fig. J-54: Automatic Cutting dialog.*

From the combo box, select **Automatic** and click [OK].
Now open the cutting via the icon on the menu bar.

You will see an overview of the planned cutting.

*Fig. J-55: Planned cutting overview.*

With the [Options] button, you can (if necessary) reset the status of the batches.
Click the [Start] button to start the cutting. The optimizations for the first group are transferred to cutting.

*Fig. J-56: Cutting overview in progress.*

If the last pattern of the group has been sent to the cutting table and cut, the next group will be loaded into cutting automatically.

### A+W Defect Optimizer

... the intelligent defect optimization.

The stockplates are scanned in conjunction with a quality scanner, e.g., from Viprotron, and any faults or defects are detected and displayed. The earlier defects are detected during the process, the lower the incurred costs.

Defects are taken into account during optimization for the restructuring of the sectional image. If there are any orders that are to be considered, then those will of course be taken into account.
Defects in residual plates are also stored, and can thus be reused later without additional inspections.

If defects cannot be avoided through the optimization process (e.g. number and size of stock lites on pattern), the optimization process tries to use smaller and thus cheaper glass panes for the defects.
Glass that is positioned on defects is automatically reported as breakage and is recut.

> **Requirements**
> The production system A+W Production as well as the A+W Realtime Optimizer are prerequisites to use the A+W Defect Optimizers.

> **Additional information**
> For more information on A+W Defect Optimizer please refer to the appropriate documentation.

### A+W DynOpt Compact

A+W DynOpt Compact is the entry level solution of A+W for Dynamic Optimizations.

The system is based on the A+W Realtime Optimizer and loads the batches, pre-optimized and sent by the prior production system A+W Production. These batch are resolved completely and re-optimized systematically and dynamically. This method improves the yield and reduces the number of residual plates to be saved.

You can consider A+W DynOpt Compact to be an automatic A+W Real-time Optimizer.

A+W DynOpt Compact works with the following two modules:
- A+W DynOpt Compact Import
- A+W DynOpt Compact Optimization

#### A+W DynOpt Compact Import

During import, the batches released for A+W DynOpt Compact are converted into so-called Cluster. A cluster is a - initially random - production unit, e.g. a rack, a group of racks, or an individual lite.

#### A+W DynOpt Compact Optimization

After the import, the processing sequence for the clusters is defined considering the available space. This more or less matches the production sequence; in special cases, clusters may be moved up in the sequence to improve the yield. You can use harp racks, A racks, or both.

About half of the computed clusters become primary clusters and the rest, secondary clusters. Primary clusters get priority 1 and are completely optimized in the optimization on hand. Secondary clusters are used as fillers; the optimization itself decides whether or not they are required.

**Example:**
Available space: 6. The space for a harp rack is 1, the space for an A rack 0,5 (in terms of harp racks, i.e. 1 harp rack = 2 A racks).
If there are as many harp racks as there are A racks and the splitting is applied to the clusters, this means: 4 harp racks plus 4 x 0.5 A racks = 6. Half of the numbers each means: two primary and two secondary harp racks and A racks.

| | Imported | Used | Primary | Secondary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Harp rack** | 16 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| **A Rack** | 17 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

*Tab. J-1: Example*

The following conditions are kept when calculating the time-line:
- The primary sorting of clusters is the production sequence.
- As long as clusters from the current batch can fill the available space, no clusters of the following batch will be used to create the time-line.
- If the secondary clusters include a glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, there are two options:
    - If the cluster consists of lites of a glass type for which there are primary lites as well, only those will be optimized. The lites of the glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, will be optimized when the cluster becomes primary.
    - If the cluster consists only of lites of a glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, the system searches the present batch for an alternative cluster which consists (at least partly) of lites of a primary glass type. If this can be found, the clusters will be exchanged; otherwise, the present cluster will not be included in the optimization.

Every step of A+W DynOpt Compact provides all primary and all secondary clusters for optimization. The primary lites will always be used for optimization and the secondary only if required. After this step, all primary clusters have been filled and can be replaced by secondary clusters or even new ones.

#### Create A+W DynOpt Compact batch

There are two ways of creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches.
- Creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches in the cluster view.
- Creating a A+W DynOpt Compact batch at cutting.

**Creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches in the cluster view**
1.  Open the dialog **Cluster view**. Select `Cutting > A+W DynOpt Compact`.
2.  On the left side, select the batch(es) you want to use to create an A+W DynOpt Compact batch.
3.  Open the context menu and select **Create A+W DynOpt Compact batch**.
4.  After the A+W DynOpt Compact batches have been created, they are displayed in the top left section of the dialog. They are headed by **+**. If you open up the tree, you can view the rack data for the batches.

**Creating a A+W DynOpt Compact batch at cutting**
1.  Open **Select a batch** dialog. Select either `Cutting > Cut optimization` or use the corresponding icon.
2.  From the batch list, select the batch you want to use to create an A+W DynOpt Compact batch.
3.  Open the context menu and select **Create A+W DynOpt Compact for batch XXXX**.
4.  When the A+W DynOpt Compact batch has been created, it appears in the top left section of the dialog, marked by **Cut&Go**. Tag the batch in the left section to display the appropriate information in section **Optimizations**.

> **Requirements**
> The production system A+W Production as well as the A+W Realtime Optimizer are prerequisites to use the A+W DynOpt Compact.
