This dialog is used for entering master data for your suppliers.

This dialog is the same for all partners. It is described in detail in connection with customers.
> ⇨ "Partner Management" on page B-805

## Supplier List

**Master Data > Partners > Supplier > Supplier List**

The dialog is used to define the suppliers of the individual products or product groups as well as the corresponding delivery times. If entries are made for a product as well as for the corresponding product group, the settings for the product will be used with priority at P.O. transfer.

The supplier file is checked when orders that include purchased articles are directly transferred to purchasing. Since this is done without using the purchase pool, a standard supplier must be defined.

Price comparison in the purchase pool is also based on the data in the supplier file.
> ⇨ Sales, "P.O. transfer" on page C-1751

This dialog offers the following tabs:

- Supplier List – Products
- Supplier List - Product Groups
- Supplier List - Conditions

### Supplier List – Products

**Master Data > Partner > Supplier > Supplier List > Products tab**

*Abb. B-537 Supplier list – Products*

This tab is used to define the suppliers who can provide a certain product.

### Products

Normally, there is just one standard supplier per product for standard orders. However, if customers order large quantities of a certain product, one that the standard supplier is unable to produce, a standard supplier for serial orders can be defined as well.

**Standard orders, Serial orders** Choose an option to define the type of orders for which these settings should be used:
- **Standard orders:**
  Standard orders are orders of the type <n.e.>, work order, internal order.
- **Serial orders:**
  Serial orders are orders of the type Serial order.

**Client, Order area** Choose a client and/or an order area to define the number area from which order numbers for internal orders should be taken.

**Supplier, Product** Choose an option to define whether the settings should apply to a supplier or a product:

**Del. time/days** Number of days it usually takes the supplier to deliver the product in question. In the price comparison of the purchase order batch, the delivery time is used as another selection criterion..

**Priority of supplier** The supplier with ranking 1 is considered to be the standard supplier.
This definition is important if there are several suppliers for a product. Direct purchase orders are always placed with the standard supplier. If no standard supplier has been defined, the purchased element or the purchase order will be transferred to the purchase pool so that you can choose a supplier.

### Internal orders/Profit center invoicing

Choose an option to define the order type:

- **None:**
  The settings apply to customer orders.
- **Internal orders:**
  Internal orders serve for filling up one's own stock. An internal customer must be defined instead of the standard supplier. In lieu of purchase orders, orders will be created automatically.

*Abb. B-552 Cutting tables*

This dialog serves to enter the production-relevant data for the cutting tables. The tables are displayed in dialog **Glass type-Jumbos-Tables** and are used for allocating glass types.
> ⇨ "Glass Type - Jumbos - Tables" on page B-903

This dialog can be accessed only if you have established the connection with the A+W Production server in company data.
> ⇨ "Company Data – Production" on page B-1009

### Key

**Table number** Number of the cutting table.

**Name** Name of the cutting table.

### Dimensions

**Width, height** Maximum stockplate size (in mm) that can be cut on this table.

### Values

**Reference point** Reference point for the cutting code. The reference point of the table marks the position of the coordinates 0/0 from where the cutting code starts. It is important in order to cut shapes correctly.
The reference point does not have to match the neutral position of the cutting head. Bystronic for example offers reflected tables with a reference point front left while the cutting head's neutral position is front right. For some tables, this can be set as a parameter.

**Z cut** Position of the Z cuts. The entry bottom or top defines the position on the cutting plan.
It is usually better to position the Z cuts near the top, i.e. away from the working area so that individual subplates can be broken across the whole width of the plate and stacked right away.
If Z cuts are planned in the sections above, there will be enough space on the breakout table to turn the lite for breaking out the Z cut.

**Start of breakout** The start of breakout depends on the spatial conditions on the shop floor. It determines the position of the residue plate as well as - to some extent - the cutting sequence (break bottom or top lite first).

**Special** A+W Production distinguishes the following two options:
- **0 = Normal:** Standard setting
- **1 = Bystronic sorter:** Choose this setting only if you are using a Bystronic sorter at all.

**Racks per cycle** Number of racks available within a cycle. Entries are necessary only if you are using cyclic optimization.

**Hierarchy** Priority for selecting the table on which the specified glass type is cut. The table with the highest priority will be used. This field will be analyzed only if A+W Production is run without machine allocation.

### Distance between cuts

*Abb. B-553 XYZ cuts on the stock plate*

**Min. dist. Y-Y cuts** The minimum distance between Y-Y cuts depends on the use of the automatic breakout line and on the distance of the Y cutting heads. For cutting tables with several Y cutting heads, the minimum distance matches the distance of the cutting wheels of two cutting heads moved together, e.g. Bystronic XYZVA = 300 mm.

**Min. dist. X-X cuts** Minimum distance between X-X cuts in case of automatic breakout.

**Max. Dist. Y-Y cuts** Maximum distance between Y-Y cuts in case of automatic breakout.

**Max. Dist. X-X cuts** Maximum distance between X-X cuts in case of automatic breakout.

### Maximum waste

**X direction** Maximum length of waste permitted for a stockplate. This is the distance in mm from outermost X cut to the edge.

**Y direction** Maximum length of waste permitted for a subplate. This is the distance in mm from outermost Y cut to the edge.

**Z direction** Maximum length of waste permitted on a Y strip. This is the distance in mm from outermost Z cut to the subplate.

Number ranges are logical organization units as well as a means to combine work processes triggered by a so-called number manager.

Dialog Number Ranges offers the following tabs:

- Number Ranges – Documents
- Number Ranges - Production
- Number Ranges - Financial Accounting
- Number Ranges – Table
> ⇨ Tutorial 2, "Number areas" on page B-506

> **Do not reset the number range during operation**
> Resetting or changing the number ranges during operation can cause problems if old document numbers should exist in a new number range. This is why you should carefully check beforehand to make sure that all documents with old numbers have been archived.

### Functions menu

Menu Functions permits to check whether the (newly) defined number ranges clash. If so, the system will issue a message to that effect.

## Number Ranges – Documents

**Master Data > Order > Number Ranges > Documents tab**

*Abb. B-565 Number Ranges – Documents*

You can use this dialog for setting up the number ranges for allocating consecutive numbers. You can allocate 8-digit numbers.

**Client, Order area** For every client, you can define special number ranges by order area. Use tab Table to choose the client and OM area the number areas of which you want to check or change.

> **Example**
> Different number ranges have been set up for the order areas for toughened and IG production. Based on the order number, the workers can see whether the order in question concerns toughened or IG production.

The number ranges of the different clients and order areas must not overlap.

**Employee** For documents, you can define different number ranges by employee.
If you do not want to bother with this, just leave the entry at `<n.e.`. In user management, every user can be allocated to the appropriate order area. The document number will be automatically loaded from the corresponding number range.

### From, Current, To

**From, to** First and last number of the number range. The document number ranges must not overlap.
To lock a document for an order area, enter 0 in both fields and 1 in field current.

**Current** Last number allocated by the system.

**By period** This field is filled by the Number ranges print program.
> ⇨ Sales, "Number ranges" on page C-1815

> **Example**
> Field by period shows the number 181 for orders. The current order number has meanwhile reached 218. If you start the print program, all orders from 182 to 218 on this list will be printed. After printing, the value in field by period will be set to 218.

> **Note**
> When entering new number ranges please make sure that number ranges do not overlap. This also applies to documents, e.g. quotations that can be entered in different order areas.

**Prefix** A separate prefix can be used per document type, e.g. for clients or order areas.

**Quotations** Quotations are independent documents. The system checks this number range at order entry.

**Orders** Orders are independent documents. The system checks this number range at order entry. Partial deliveries as well as complaints belong to the document Order. For the latter, special number ranges are set up on tab Production. These number ranges must not clash.

**Purchase Orders** Purchase orders are independent documents. The system checks this number range at P.O. entry.

**Supplier enquiries** Enquiries are independent documents. The system checks this number range at order entry.

**Invoices** An order gets an invoice number when the invoice is printed. This will be saved in the order. The invoice number is independent of the order number.

**Credit notes** Credit notes are independent documents. The system checks this number range at credit note entry. Generally, the system expects different number ranges for invoices and credit notes. To use the invoice number range for credit notes you have to check the checkbox **Cred.no. = Doc.no.** in company data.
> ⇨ "Company Data > Documents" on page B-952

**Delivery notes** The delivery note number is assigned when the delivery note is printed, and is saved in the order.

**Batch No. A+W Production archives** When an order is archived, an STST file is created which - among others - includes this batch number. This transfer file is imported by A+W Production and triggers the archiving in A+W Production.
The batch number is analyzed only for the order area defined in **Company data > Archives** in field **Order area for batch number**.
This means that you set up this number range only for the client `<n.e.>` and for the order area selected in company data.
> ⇨ "Company Data > Archives" on page B-989

## Lock Code

**Master Data > Order > Lock Codes**

*Abb. B-569 Lock Code*

This dialog serves to define the lock codes. Lock codes can be used to lock documents for certain actions while automatically raising their status. This means that the document cannot reach the locked status but is instead diverted to another status point (process).

> **Example: Partial delivery without invoicing**
> If partial deliveries must not be invoiced, the system has to be able to recognize a partial delivery as such. In this case, no partial invoice can be created for the partial delivery. The status of the partial delivery will instead be raised automatically. After the order is diverted to Transfer to archives, the partial delivery cannot be edited any further.

Lock codes for complaints and partial deliveries are preset in the company data.
> ⇨ "Company Data > Documents" on page B-952

> **Please discuss changes with A+W Software GmbH**
