## 1. New installation of version 6

The following installation instructions assume that there is no previous version installed. Setup and additional configuration options are described in the configuration instructions.

### 1.1 Overview and the basics

The following list provides an overview of the work that must be done during installation:

- Installation of the A+W Clarity Suite
- Installation of the A+W Clarity Suite add-ins (Dispatch, Sales, etc.)

The A+W Clarity Suite is the new interface for A+W Enterprise. In the first step, the Dispatch Control module will be made available. The Sales module is planned in the second step.

### 1.2 Requirements

So that the new interface can establish a connection to A+W Enterprise, the following components have to be installed on the PC:

- A+W Infrastructure 6 Middleware
- A+W Infrastructure 6 Collector Service

#### 1.2.1 Data from production

In order to be able to display data from production within the A+W Clarity Suite, the following AWSOA services have to be installed and accessible:

- A+W CIM 6 Barcoding Services
- A+W Planning 6 Job Services

The installation instructions are available at `Installation CIM`.

However, these services are optional. The A+W Clarity Suite can also run without them. However, if the services are installed and accessible, the production information is added to the data automatically.

### 1.3 Dependencies

In order for the service to function properly, the A+W infrastructure services has to be installed on the system.

The Service Locator has to be accessible.

### 1.3.1 A+W Clarity Suite dependencies under Linux/AIX

For the set-up of the ICE environment, you have to pay attention to Chapter 8 of the A+W Enterprise configuration instructions! Without this environment, none of the back end services will run!

Essentially, before the set-up, you have to check the following files under Linux/AIX (these should always be up-to-date if possible):

- `$ALCIBPRG/install/config/iceconfig.1.0.gz` (templates for set-up of the services)
- `$ALCIBPRG/cmd/iceconfig` (script for configuration of the services)
- `$ALCIBPRG/cmd/icenodestart` (script for set-up of the ICE node)
- `$ALCIBPRG/cmd/icenodestartint` (internal script for starting the ICE node)
- `$ALCIBPRG/cmd/icenodestop` (script for stopping the ICE node)
- `$ALCIBPRG/cmd/icegridservers` (script for querying the ICE node)
- `$ALCIBPRG/al_bin/Linux/dispatchservice` (binary with the dispatch functionalities)

For the use of the A+W Logistic Optimizer also:

- `$ALCIBPRG/al_bin/Linux/logistickbackendservice` (binary with the functionalities for route optimization)

### 1.4 Procedure

The A+W Clarity Suite has to be installed in the A+W SetupLauncher. The dependent components should be selected automatically in the SetupLauncher.

The additional add-ins can then be installed on each computer.

### 1.5 Settings

None.

### 1.6 Result of the installation

After the installation, the program can be called from the A+W Start menu folder.

### 1.7 Uninstalling

The program can be uninstalled via the Programs and Functions dialog in Windows.
