long_description: "This comprehensive technical guide details the setup and configuration for advanced logistics and business process customization within the A+W Business software. It outlines the integration with the A+W Logistics Optimizer, covering functionalities such as route management, the display of optimized routes, and the definition of surcharges for freight revenues. A significant portion of the document is dedicated to explaining the 'Multisite mode', which allows the system to be configured for operation across multiple physical sites with either shared or separate databases. It also introduces 'A+W Smart Delivery', a mobile application designed for truck drivers to manage their routes, update delivery statuses (e.g., accepted, partially accepted, declined), and report breakages directly from the field, with status changes reflected back in the main system. A major chapter is devoted to 'Customizing', a powerful feature that enables users to create custom formulas and logic to extend the software's standard functionality without altering the source code. This includes creating custom UI buttons, hotkeys, form printing logic, and linking formulas to various application events like saving a record or changing a field. The document provides detailed syntax, a comprehensive function reference, and practical examples for creating these formulas, covering everything from simple data validation to complex EDI and Purchase Order transfer modifications. Finally, it briefly touches upon features for quotation evaluation and statistics."
