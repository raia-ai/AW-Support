long_description: "This document provides in-depth technical guidance for configuring and using various modules within the A+W Enterprise software system. It is intended for system administrators and advanced users responsible for maintaining and customizing the software's behavior. Key topics covered include the setup of configurable texts for different document types like invoices and credit notes, detailing how texts are determined and generated. A significant portion is dedicated to the complex 'Product Group Logic,' which defines how products are categorized using a hierarchical structure and specific matchcodes for glass, plastic, and other materials. The manual explains customer-specific product group configurations for clients like SCHOLL, Pilkington, and Wernberg. It also outlines the 'Cost Center Logic,' detailing how cost centers are automatically determined based on various parameters like department, product group, or item number, and how this can be overridden. Furthermore, the document describes the process for DXF file imports, SN (Shaping/Nesting) interactions, and SNLive sketch generation, including configuration of file paths and environment variables. Finally, it delves into the comprehensive 'Cost Calculation' module, explaining how material, machine, and personnel costs are determined, processed, and written back from purchase orders, including handling of discounts, special prices, and marginal income checks."
