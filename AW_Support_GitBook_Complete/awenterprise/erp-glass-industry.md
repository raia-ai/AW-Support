### A+W Enterprise introduces itself
This introduction shall give you an overview of A+W Enterprise an ERP software solution for the flat glass processing industry.

After a short description of the program and its benefits, the following paragraph explains the scope of A+W Enterprise. It describes the companies, company structures, and fields of activity supported by A+W Enterprise.

The general overview is followed by a description of how to use A+W Enterprise and its peculiarities. Keyboard operation plays a major role here. A wealth of shortcuts and hotkeys permit the fast and efficient use of the system.

The next section deals with some of the master data. Master data include data on partners, articles, bills of material, product groups, and prices/terms. All business areas (sales, purchasing, production, inventory, dispatch) use these data. They are the foundation of the program.

This is followed by a description of the business processes handled by A+W Enterprise. Many of the business processes are integrated and automated in A+W Enterprise. The monitoring and triggering of individual workflows is no longer necessary.

For more information on A+W Enterprise please refer to the A+W Enterprise manual, the A+W Enterprise product description, or the online help.

#### Features
This section introduces the structure and system environment of A+W Enterprise.
- Adaptation - modular structure
- A+W Enterprise in glass trade
- A+W Enterprise in operations with single or multi-level production
- Groups of companies

**Objectives**
- Learning about different business targets and structures in the glass industry and knowing how A+W Enterprise can support them with its modular structure
- Learning about the software concept and system architecture

**Benefit**
A thorough understanding of the system architecture and the modular structure of A+W Enterprise are prerequisite for the handling and operation of the individual areas and the gathering of the necessary knowledge.

**Definitions**
- **Purchasing link:** fully automatic handling of internal orders among two different A+W Enterprise systems (clients) of the same group. Up until the point of locking, changes will be automatically booked on item level for all clients.

> **Note: Scalability**
> Thanks to its modular structure and system architecture, A+W Enterprise can be adapted to individual requirements. This way, A+W Enterprise can be adjusted to the performance and the complexity of the system.
>
> **Glass trade:** are companies buying tempered, laminated, and insulated glass, cutting and processing it themselves. A+W Enterprise mainly handles the commercial side of this operation.
>
> **IG, tempered, or laminated glass producer with trade:** are companies producing functional glass apart from their trading business. This business type uses A+W Enterprise's commercial features and the functions of the production planning and control system A+W Production.
>
> **Groups of companies:** are groups of companies of a variety of organizational structures.
>
> **Multi-stage productions:** are companies with great production depth that include several classic production areas (tempered+LAMI+IG)

> **Note: System environment**
> The Unix-based A+W Enterprise offers a graphic user interface (MS Windows); thanks to its client server architecture (3-tier model) it can be adapted step by step to individual business requirements, and can be extended anytime.

#### Adaptation - modular structure
Modern software packages come with a solid system architecture and well-founded, specialist knowledge.

A+W Enterprise can be adapted flexibly. This means that A+W Enterprise can be adapted to the individual requirements and the size of the business. Thanks to the modular system structure, certain modules can be added later on in the project.

The business structures and processes of glass merchants, IG, tempered, and laminated glass producers as well as groups of companies are optimally supported.

Based on a detailed analysis of the business situation and the ensuing selection of suitable functions and modules, A+W Enterprise can be used to configure an application that can be flexibly adapted to all kinds of business structures - trade, IG, tempered, or laminated glass producer, of a big group of companies.

#### A+W Enterprise in glass trade
Merchants are companies who buy tempered, laminated, and insulated glass, doing the cutting and processing themselves.

In this kind of company, A+W Enterprise and other A+W products support the handling of sales, purchasing, tracking of orders, and invoicing. There are a number of comfortable functions for quotation handling such as creation of alternative quotes, comprehensive replacement of products, and recalculation. These include:
- Document entry
- Import and export interfaces
- Cutting optimization
- Inventory management
- Dispatch control and optimization
- Management Information System (MIS)
- Linking of sales offices
- Workflow support

**Document entry**
What with the ever decreasing delivery times, it is essential to handle orders quickly and easily. This is why A+W Enterprise supports your order entry with product and shape sketches, selection dialogs, standard values, and various technical and logical feasibility checks. The large variety of processing steps and the large number of possible combinations in the field of IG are easily handled by means of bills of materials.

**Import and export interfaces**
Apart from manual input, A+W Enterprise also offers various interfaces for importing orders directly from the customers' system. This reduces input times as well as input errors and improves customer relations.

Orders can be accepted automatically via the A+W standard interface or individual customer interfaces.

You can also import supplier data via A+W Enterprise. Provided that the supplier also uses A+W Enterprise, prices, enquiries, and orders can be easily transferred online. A transfer of POs to third-party systems is possible with the A+W standard interfaces or suppliers' custom procedures (e.g. Dorma PO service).

Another way of speeding up the communication between customer and supplier is an integrated fax or email connection which allows to create quotations, orders, or purchase orders in top quality on the spot, and send them to the customer right away.

**Fig. A-2: Information flow in a group of glass producing companies**
*(Image showing a central 'Trade' entity connected to 'Sales office', 'Customer', and 'Supplier' via the 'Network (Internet)'.)*

**Inventory management**
Depending on the size and complexity of the business, you can also use the Inventory management module as a further extension. It allows stockkeeping of all glass types within the company and can also be used for fittings and other accessories.

The new A+W Smart Companion app can be used to manage the stock in A+W Enterprise. With the help of the A+W Smart Companion - Stock module, POs can be booked into stock (in addition, ordered parts are reported directly to A+W Production), and stock movements or stock removals can be made. Furthermore, you can take inventory of a stock directly on the mobile end user device. The stock module includes the full functional scope of the inventory module.

**Dispatch control**
Shipping is supported by the A+W Enterprise dispatch planning and control system. This module provides the operator with detailed information on scheduled routes, quantities, weights, and the required means of transport. The managing clerk can move or cancel whole routes, individual orders, or items. Even the currently available units are displayed, and by checking for missing quantities, backlogs or breakage can be moved to future routes.
With the A+W Logistics Optimizer, individual routes or the entire dispatch activity can be optimized.

**Management Information System (MIS)**
To control the market activities, the glass trade can use the manifold possibilities of the Management Information System. Apart from various, predefined statistics, this module offers a free SQL interface for defining individual queries. This provides valuable information on the current market situation, customer behavior, and the company development. The integrated report generator allows to edit all lists in individual formats.

**Linking of sales offices**
Let us assume a glass merchant wants to open a sales office in a nearby town to be closer to the market. He will need IT support to handle the sales side there as well. The network options allow to link the terminals in this office directly with the A+W Enterprise server at the company's headquarters.

To run this office as a separate profit centre, you can even set up an independent office structure which is also linked with headquarters. In this case, both clients can be evaluated separately but are still linked via automatic document transfer.

**Workflow support**
A+W Enterprise offers a powerful, user- and document-related resubmission system with periodical and free cycles. An integrated message system allows to define messages for users or departments which will not be lost even if the persons in question are not available at present. Moreover, a priority-controlled 'notes' system makes sure that vital information on customers, suppliers, articles, etc. are available at the appropriate terminals.

#### A+W Enterprise in operations with single or multi-level production
A typical IG, tempered or laminated glass producer who also trades glass, will use the same commercial functions as a glass merchant. Additionally, he requires a detailed production and capacity planning as well as flexible production control. Being a modern company, he uses barcoding to monitor his production.
- Free shapes - shapes
- Transfer to production planning and production (A+W Production)
- Production control (A+W Production) and shop date collection (barcoding)
- A+W Smart Companion for barcoding and stock

**Fig. A-3: Information transfer in a group of companies that produces its own glass**
*(Image showing a central 'Production' entity, also connected to 'Trade', 'Sales office', 'Customer', and 'Supplier' via the 'Network (Internet)'.)*

**Free shapes - shapes**
Since more and more shapes are being ordered, A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) can be used to define free shapes for production purposes. The integrated ITOE (integration of the CAD software and A+W Enterprise document processing) allows you to use both the fully graphical entry and classic entry (entry of parameters for shapes and processings) in the order entry in parallel and depending on the situation. The import of CAD files for an item is also possible. Here, CAD design and the A+W Enterprise BOMs are synchronized bi-directionally.

**Transfer to A+W Production**
All production-relevant orders are backdated by the production planning and control system (A+W Production) based on the delivery date requested by the customer. Date and capacity planning is influenced by machinery restrictions, use of capacity, through times, allocated technologies, inventory, purchasing, etc. Based on the production and supply times, individual work processes will be exactly scheduled; the necessary machine capacities will be reserved.

The duration of a shift or agreements regarding special shifts can be changed anytime by the production manager and are immediately available in the scheduling system. Should production capacities be exceeded, whole production jobs will be postponed. If machinery restrictions cannot be fulfilled, the system will automatically use alternative machines. An information system shows the current status of the scheduled technologies and capacities at all times.

The call for production releases the previously compiled batches for production. This can be done automatically or interactively. After optimization, the control data for the individual machines are available.

By using production reporting and PDC, the current production status can be viewed in A+W Enterprise at any time.

#### Groups of companies
Groups of companies can be structured in various ways. They vary from a loose union of independent companies to a big group with a severe hierarchy. This puts different demands on the software. In addition to the functions for trade and producers of IG, tempered, and laminated glass, A+W Enterprise also offers some functions for groups of companies.
- Central master data management
- Purchasing link
- Internal invoicing of services within a group
- Group reporting
- Overall dispatch planning (via plant)

**Fig. A-4: Group of companies**
*(Image showing a corporate structure with 'Headquarters' and 'Sales office' connecting to 'Customer', 'Distributor', and 'Supplier', and also to production plants 'TG', 'IG', and 'LAMI'.)*

**Central master data management**
In a group of companies with several A+W Enterprise clients, master data can be centrally managed and distributed. A+W Enterprise provides various transfer functions for this purpose which allow to distribute certain master data completely or partly, automatically or interactively. Here, it can be defined in detail (down to the field level) which master data are managed centrally and which components of the master data are managed logically.

**Purchasing link**
A+W Enterprise can transfer orders automatically from the merchant to the connected production sites, including reports on changed dates, production releases, and information on already available quantities.

**Group reporting**
To speed up political reactions, the management can use integrated group statistics to compile data from the individual sites.

#### System environment
The following subjects have been taken special care of to create a powerful IT system:
- Operating safety
- System availability
- supported hardware
- Extension
- Networks
- Access restriction and control

A+W Enterprise offers a graphic user interface; thanks to its client server architecture it can be adapted step by step to the business requirements, and extended anytime.

**Fig. A-5: 3-tier architecture**
*(Image depicting a 3-tier architecture: 'Client-PC Windows' (Display level) connects to a 'Unix server' (Logical level), which in turn connects to a 'Data layer' (database).)*

The selected system architecture guarantees long-term investment safety and applicability to all types of business.

This chapter provides information on:
- System architecture
- Data security
- User interface
- Maintenance and service

**System architecture**
A+W Enterprise is based on the operating system Unix and can be run on AIX or Linux servers.

Thanks to the clear separation of database, application, and surface (3-tier architecture), the system can be flexibly adapted to the individual requirements. With a growing number of users, you can increase the performance without having to change databases and surface (user PCs).

The relational database INFORMIX is used for storage purposes. The underlying data structure is open and accessible via online documentation. Data can be analyzed anytime by means of standard software. Microsoft Word or Excel can directly access the A+W Enterprise data. Likewise, it is possible to transfer data to Excel or Word from any A+W Enterprise menu.

A+W Enterprise can be completely integrated in a network. Local networks are supported as well as wide area networks (WAN), using dial-in connections or dedicated lines. Interfaces to email, fax and telephone lines are available as well.

**Data security**
The application is completely transaction-safe. This means that A+W Enterprise actions (e.g issuing invoices and booking statistics) will be performed either completely, or not at all. The elements used allow to restore the data almost completely and - in any case - consistently even in case of a system crash. Backups will be made automatically at a defined, or during operation.

**User interface**
A+W Enterprise' user interface resembles the typical Windows dialogs. They offer buttons, icon bars, context menus, and many other Windows elements.

Since the operating interface is run on a separate Windows application (FIX/Win) while A+W Enterprise itself is run on an application server, the system does not require a high-performance terminal PC.

**Maintenance and service**
Every A+W Enterprise installation includes a comprehensive service concept. Service includes regular updates dispatched via network which are installed outside regular operating hours. Maintenance is generally done via network link so that data can be transferred at the same time. This is a very effective means of support.

#### Benefits of A+W Enterprise as compared with A+W Business
A+W Software GmbH offers two commercial software systems: A+W Enterprise and A+W Business. Both systems are tailored to the needs of the flat glass industry and its commercial and administrative requirements. Whether A+W Business or A+W Enterprise is the right solution, mainly depends on the size and structure of the individual company.

Large companies with quite a lot of subsidiaries will usually profit from the architecture of the A+W Enterprise system. For individual companies or small groups of companies run like individual companies however, A+W Business should be the right solution.

Companies looking for integrated and possibly automatic processing will find A+W Enterprise more suitable while companies preferring a user-driven workflow will find A+W Business a satisfactory system.

The A+W Enterprise multi-site functionality allows the mapping of several branch offices in one system and the use of a series of branch office-spanning functionalities (dispatch planning, stock, overall evaluations, common master data, etc.). A sophisticated rights system regulates who may access which data (globally or locally, reading or writing). This also reduces the EDP management effort drastically.

### Supported Business Processes
This section introduces the business processes and the interaction of the individual modules in connection with the processes

**Objectives**
Introducing the business processes and the interaction of the individual modules in connection with the processes.

**Benefit**
A+W Enterprise's modular structure supports all commercial business units of an enterprise and offers integrated interfaces to the shop floor. Thorough knowledge of the A+W Enterprise modules is therefore the basis of the efficient, process-oriented use of the system.

**Definitions**
- **Graphic product entry:** Supports order entry by a muntin editor, shape input, a bill of material tree, and A+W CAD Designer (Shapes).
- **Completion report/Barcoding:** Production planning and control system for single- or multi-level production. A permanent status report and controlling.
- **Order pool:** All purchasing proposals are collected in the order pool.
- **Sales module:** The sales module serves to enter commercial transactions, taking into account the maintained master data (exchange/addition rules, feasibility and restriction checks) and pass them on to the system for further processing. This includes e.g. the scheduling of processing steps, reservation of products on stock, or the reporting of purchase elements to the order pool.
- **Cost calculation:** Cost calculation takes into account material-, labour-, and machinery costs depending on the configuration.
- **Production module:** The production module A+W Production includes requirement report, production planning, production control, and completion reports (Barcoding). All production-relevant data (requirements, dates, etc.) are automatically determined based on the order and on master data.
- **Production planning:** Based on commercial information, production planning determines all production-relevant data and submits them to a logical restriction check.
- **Production control:** Production control transfers the previously created production batches to the optimization program A+W Sequence Optimizer; the result is used to create the machinery control.
- **Inventory module:** The inventory module serves for internal stock management and stocktaking. Demands are automatically reported when the stock on hand falls below the defined minimum.
- **Dispatch control:** Dispatch control handles route planning and organization, rack management, delivery monitoring, checks missing quantities, and issues delivery notes.
- **Purchasing module:** The purchasing module allows to order articles and book the receipt of goods in the system.
- **Information system:** In addition to MIS, A+W Enterprise allows the user to define individual queries. SQL queries are based on the A+W Enterprise data model.

### Business areas in A+W Enterprise - modules
The business processes and business areas shown in the diagram are summed up in the individual modules of A+W Enterprise. A+W Enterprise guarantees the seamless interaction of the individual modules and other programs by means of a number of functions like interfaces, comprehensive work-flow support, archiving, and printing.

**Fig. A-6: Schematic view of the A+W Enterprise functions**
*(Image showing a diagram of A+W Enterprise modules: Sales, Dispatch, Production, Stock, Purchase, all drawing from Supplies (Master data, User management, System configuration) and feeding into Reporting/statistics.)*

Describing all the business processes in A+W Enterprise would exceed the scope of this introduction; still, we are going to convey an overview of the individual modules and their interaction. This is why we recommend to present the individual modules and their interaction based on the main headers and main dialogs of A+W Enterprise. Program parts and individual dialogs will be shown and explained. The trainer is responsible for making sure that the dialogs show practical data.

### Sales
Sales draws up quotations, enters orders, and calculates prices. The staff issue delivery notes, invoices, and credit notes. This includes the following areas:
- Quotation/order entry
- Graphics modules at document entry
- Entry w/o prices
- Cost calculation
- Releases
- Invoices
- Credit notes

#### Quotation/order entry
**Fig. A-7: Order entry**
*(Screenshot of the Order Entry dialog in A+W Enterprise.)*

Document entry offers comfortable functions for the creation of alternative quotes, comprehensive product replacement, and recalculation.

Input and management of the individual items in a document is made easy by a lot of components such as selection tools, shape images, visual article search, item status, etc. The system will ask only for data necessary to completely describe a product.

Product variants - based on different processing steps, colors, shapes, sizes, and combinations - are compiled into BOMs in master data. The BOM allows to describe products and change them as required in the individual documents.

Replacement rules, feasibility and restriction checks control the feasibility of a product.

This is where you enter the orders received from your customers into the system for further processing. The individual processing steps will be scheduled based on the requested delivery date. Products kept on stock will be reserved while those to be ordered from one of your suppliers are passed on to Purchasing.

#### Graphic support for entering products at order entry
A+W Enterprise offers various graphics modules to support the input of standard shapes and free shapes. The following modules are included in A+W Enterprise or can be integrated:

**A+W Enterprise Shape input**
A+W Enterprise offers functions for entering shapes. This is usually done by means of an extensive shape catalog. You can also define free shapes, or import them e.g. from A+W CAD Designer (Shapes).

**Fig. A-8: Shape input**
*(Screenshot of the Shape-dimensions dialog for defining a custom shape.)*

**Graphic muntin editor**
The muntin editor allows the detailed processing of bars. You can change the position of horizontal and vertical bars, or click on the bars to remove them.

**Fig. A-9: Muntin input at order entry**
*(Screenshot of the G. bars input dialog.)*

**Graphic BOM tree**
The graphic BOM tree allows to navigate through the BOM with the mouse. BOM levels can be easily opened and viewed. This gives you an exact idea of the product structure. To make things clearer, icons were allocated to the individual article types. This makes it easy to distinguish glass, spacers, muntins, and processing steps. For glass, A+W Enterprise shows the name and the assembly position as well as - if applicable - the pattern or coating.

**Fig. A-10: BOM presentation in the order entry**
*(Screenshot of the BOM view dialog showing the product structure and a graphic representation.)*

**A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) - ITOE**
At document entry, the product and all processing steps can be displayed. Visualization is a great help for the user when it comes to checking the processed lites. When the product and the processing step have been dimensioned, a A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) sketch is created automatically which is presented in the item dialog real-time.

**Fig. A-11: Graphic display of processing steps in A+W CAD Designer (Shapes)**
*(Screenshot of the BOM view with an integrated CAD drawing of a processed lite.)*

#### Cost calculation
**Fig. A-12: Cost calculation for a float glass lite**
*(Screenshot of the Production cost calculation dialog.)*

You can use the following cost types in A+W Enterprise to calculate the total cost of a product: Material cost of material on stock, material cost of purchased elements, machine cost, and labour cost.

A+W Enterprise determines the material cost at quotation/order entry. Machine and labour costs are determined by the production planning and control system A+W Production in connection with production planning. When defining the settings for cost calculation you can decide if A+W Enterprise shall only use material costs, or material, machinery and labour costs.

**Cost of material on stock**
A+W Enterprise calculates the cost of material on stock based on a material cost list. This list shows the average purchase price plus the storing costs, material overheads, etc. You can also define an average loss for an article which A+W Enterprise will automatically include in the calculation.

**Material cost purchased elements**
A+W Enterprise calculates the material costs for purchased elements (including sub-products) from the prices and conditions defined for the supplier. When using the Purchasing module, the costs for the sales item are updated whenever a purchase price is changed.

**Machinery costs**
Machinery costs are based on the operating time of the machine, and on the rates defined. The runtime is determined by the production planning system A+W Production.

**Personnel costs**
Personnel costs result from the time determined by the production planning system A+W Production and the workplace costs (team or single person).

#### Releases
When it is released, the order leaves the input level. All necessary processing and purchasing actions will be transferred to the purchase pool or to the production management system. Moreover, the order is also reported to the dispatch control system to schedule transport capacities.

#### Invoices
Invoicing is based on the terms of delivery and payment defined in the order. Partial or collective invoices can be agreed which are usually issued after the goods have been shipped. Once issued, an invoice cannot be corrected.

Price corrections are possible only by issuing a credit note, or sending an additional invoice. Apart from complete, partial, and collective invoices, cash sale invoices serve to enter order, delivery note, and invoice simultaneously; this is a useful function for cash sales. Under certain circumstances, glass can be invoiced from production to trade.

#### Credit notes
Cancelled orders, damage in transit, or customer complaints can result in partial or complete crediting of an order. You can also credit a lump sum, referring to the invoice.

### Production
The production planning and control system A+W Production handles the whole control and process of single- or multi-stepped production.
- Requirement report
- Production planning (process and material optimization)
- Production control
- Completion report/Registration of production data

#### Requirement report
Based on the commercial information in the order and master data, the production planning and control system determines the requirements and the production dates. This is the basis for compiling production-relevant data. The scheduling result is saved in the order, can be changed or confirmed in the production management system, and applied to the production jobs acc. to individual criteria.

To get an overview of past, present, and future production quantities, the production management system offers evaluations by various criteria.

#### Production planning
In connection with A+W Production, production planning converts commercial information into production data. Planning considers production-relevant master data, dates, capacities, and technical and logical restrictions. Work schedules can be changed virtually (rescheduled, edited) or accepted. You can change a date or machine, split an item, etc. Machines can be locked for certain dates in production planning if required (for scheduled repairs for example), or you can change capacity limits (short-term machine failure or personnel bottleneck). Document-related and saved planning data are the basis for production control.

#### Production control
The production lots are transferred via interfaces to optimization programs which then convert the data into machinery control.

#### Completion report/Registration of production data
The registration of production data (via barcode) allows to trace the production status in general, or per document.

### Inventory
Inventory management serves to keep, maintain, and check the stock on hand. This starts with the release of the document and the corresponding stock procurement, and reaches as far as inventory management.

A+W Enterprise can handle the following inventory types:
- Standard stock for all articles, variants, etc.
- Box stock for complete boxes of lites
- Stock to allocate articles to slots

A+W Enterprise generally keeps discrete quantities (pcs). Pieces are automatically converted into the appropriate basic units (sqm, linear meters).

The inventory module offers functions for manual receipts, manual withdrawals, and stocktaking. The stock information system shows the material movements in detail.

Inventory is closely linked with Sales and Purchasing. Stock additions and withdrawals are automatically created, based on bookings.

Based on the sold and ordered quantities, A+W Enterprise calculates the available stock on hand. This allows to forecast the development of the stock on hand. Using the minimum and alarm stock, the inventory module automatically issues PO suggestions for purchasing, based on the physical and available stock.
- Requirement report
- Stock management
- Inventory
- Assessment

#### Requirement report
If the quantity falls below a defined threshold, the article in question should be ordered so as not to impede production. You can enter two thresholds in A+W Enterprise, the alarm stock and the minimum stock. These can be configured for every article. If the quantity falls below the alarm stock, A+W Enterprise will inform you that this article needs to be ordered. The quantity should not fall below the minimum stock, neither in reality nor in connection with a capacity planning forecast. A+W Enterprise will report this as well.

#### Stock management
Stock on hand is managed by permanent stocktaking. All additions to and withdrawals from stock will be booked in A+W Enterprise. The actual stock on hand is therefore visible in A+W Enterprise at any time.

#### Inventory
We recommend permanent stocktaking to fulfil the requirements of the annual inventory. Permanent stocktaking allows to determine at a given date the stock on hand by type, quantity, value, without having to count every single item. At least once per business year, it needs to be checked whether the quantities booked in A+W Enterprise match the actual stock. Stocktaking can thus be done e.g. at a time when the stock is low.

#### Assessment
A loss of value in general can be handled acc. to the lowest value principle at stocktaking. This principle says that all current assets have to be maximally assessed with their purchase price or production costs. If the actual value on the balance date is lower than the purchase price/production costs, the lower value has to be entered in the closing balance.

### Logistics (Dispatch)
Routes are planned by means of shipping control.
- Route planning and organization
- Delivery monitoring
- Missing quantity check
- Delivery note

#### Route planning and organization
A+W Enterprise shipping control allows to view and edit routes by date. Routes, entire orders or even individual order items can be moved to another date. Preliminary delivery notes, loading lists and supplementary loading lists are available early on.

#### Delivery monitoring
Delivery schedule management allows to enter and analyze large orders for which an exact delivery schedule is available at order entry. The delivery schedule can be changed even after a document has been released.

#### Missing quantity check
The check for missing quantities allows to determine whether all quantities of an item or order have been packed and are ready for shipment. You can change the quantities if necessary (if e.g. barcodes have been read incorrectly). The delivery note can be issued only after the total order quantity has been reported packed.

#### Delivery note
Delivery notes are issued when an order is dispatched. On the one hand, this serves as a proof for the customer, and also shows the status of the order. You can issue complete or partial delivery notes. Partial delivery notes will be issued if the order is not shipped in one, but in several parts.

### Purchase
Purchasing allows to order products, register the receipt of those products, and check invoices.
- PO pool
- Inquiry and PO
- Notification and receipt of goods
- Invoice check

#### PO pool
Articles defined as purchased elements in A+W Enterprise are passed on to the order pool as purchasing proposals. If articles are withdrawn from stock and the actual stock falls below a defined threshold as a result, the inventory module will create PO suggestions that are transferred to the PO pool. The same applies to the reservation of articles via production planning if the forecasted stock falls below a defined threshold. Purchase orders can also be entered manually.

#### Inquiry and PO
Purchasing analyses the PO suggestions, grouping them by article type and reservation date. It issues inquiries to suppliers, checks alternatives, and orders articles.

#### Notification and receipt of goods
Scheduled and received deliveries are booked by the purchasing staff. Suppliers' confirmations can be entered as notifications. This allows to monitor the stock on hand for purchase planning, and to check whether the goods are received on time.

#### Invoice check
When the receipt of goods has been entered, the system checks the invoices received. The system allows to handle individual documents as well as partial or collective orders. First, the system checks the goods received for the entire order. In case of differences, it will check the individual items until the user terminates this. After the invoice check, the appropriate data are transferred to the supplier or purchasing statistics. The system can transfer data to financial accounting and cost accounting.

### Management
Prerequisite for systematic controlling as a basis for management decisions are the input and constant checking of business data. A+W Enterprise offers the following approaches for gathering and presenting management information:
- Information System (MIS)
- User-defined queries

#### Sales

**Budgets**
There is a budgeting tool for the sales representatives. It serves to define and manage budgets for the entire company as well as for individual projects. You can create distribution matrices, distribution vectors, budgets, and compare default/actual values. Project budgets are versatile, allowing to manage project accounts and lists, assembly costs, or even payroll accounting.

**Commission**
A+W Enterprise considers commission even at document entry. It calculates the commission based on keys which may be based on customers, product groups, or the contribution margin. When an invoice or a credit note is released, A+W Enterprise will book the appropriate, order-related commission.

### Information System (MIS)
All A+W Enterprise data can be used for analyses and statistics. Data are available in certain levels of compression. In the sales area, these are the classical data such as salesman, customer, product group, industry, turnover (quantity and amount) and for purchasing, data on suppliers, products, quantities received, prices, etc. The data are easily accessible at any time. The user can use the results of queries or define database queries at random. The results are presented as a table and can be edited and printed in various ways. The inventory module offers information on average stock on hand, throughput, and scope. Regarding production/barcoding, the system provides information on machinery, produced quantities, down times, personnel, through times, etc.

The document search is a useful tool. This allows to search through quotations, orders, delivery notes, and invoices by different criteria. Information includes general data (customer, date, delivery date), references, order text as well as item data (dimensions, quantities, contribution margin, etc.). There are standard queries regarding partly produced, partly shipped, and partly invoiced orders.

### User-defined queries
Apart from the predefined queries in the A+W Enterprise information system, the A+W Enterprise system menu offers the function 'SQL queries'. This function allows to change existing queries as well as defining and executing new queries. To facilitate the definition of queries, the software reference on the corresponding sections include field descriptions as well as the corresponding database fields. You can also use the system menu to view the table documentation.

### Search
Depending on the type of field you have selected, A+W Enterprise offers different search functions and lookup helps.

#### <F8> (Matchcode)
**Fig. A-22: Matchcode search Dialog**
*(Screenshot of the 'Find Article' dialog, used for alphanumeric search.)*

Many fields allow to search for an alphanumeric value (max. 8 characters) (matchcode/repetition of article name). The matchcode is a freely definable keyword in article or partner data, e.g. a company name. The matchcode can consist of letters and numbers. Entering a start value will restrict the search. If you enter no matchcode, the system will show all results, in alphanumerical order.

> **Extended SELO**
> In the current version, an expanded selo logic is active by default. A search dialog contains several fields, whose values, when input, can reduce the quantity of hits. If the search is started with `<F8>`, the value input field Matchcode is populated on start with `<F9>` the numeric field, e.g. order number.
> For a detailed description, see the individual chapters, e.g.: Sales.
> - Sales, "Find orders" on page D-1069
> - Sales, "Find market partner" on page D-1087
> - Sales, "Find article" on page D-1097

#### <F9> (<SELO>)
**Fig. A-23: Selo search dialog**
*(Screenshot of the 'Find Article' dialog, used for numerical search.)*

A+W Enterprise opens a reference guide that allows to search for a numerical value (max. 8 digits). Entering a start value will restrict the search. The system will show all results if you enter nothing or 0.

#### Extended search
**Fig. A-24: Extended search dialog**
*(Screenshot of an expanded 'Find Article' search dialog with more search criteria and results list.)*

In the new expanded search function, `<F8>`, `<F9>`, and `<F2>` are available as an expanded search.

#### Introduction
A+W Enterprise is a fully-integrated multi-site-capable ERP system for corporate groups and upscale medium-sized companies in the flat glass finishing industry.

This comprehensive system includes the sections sales management, sales support, purchasing management, inventory management, and dispatch planning. The master data are the basis of all modules.

A thorough understanding of the system architecture and the modular structure of A+W Enterprise are prerequisite for the handling and operation of the individual areas and the gathering of the necessary knowledge.

The tutorial on the Master data module handles the basics of the total A+W Enterprise.

Please note that the different dialogs are in connection with particular functions, and so they must be released separately. If you have questions, please contact A+W Software GmbH.

**Sets of Topics**
This tutorial offers the following sets of topics:
- "Master data organization and maintenance" on page B-74
- "Exercises" on page B-82

> **Target group and prerequisite knowledge**
> Tutorial is meant for users entering and maintaining master data in A+W Enterprise. Basic knowledge of EDP and Windows are prerequisite for maintaining master data in A+W Enterprise.

### Master Data
The master data form the core of all modules and functions and affects all usage levels.

The master data area can be divided into several subgroups:
- Keys
- Market partners
- Articles
- Prices and conditions
- Miscellaneous

**Objectives**
- Introducing the individual master data sections (partners, articles, bill of material, product groups, prices, and terms), its structure, and characteristics
- Knowing the Shared Memory function

**Benefit**
All A+W Enterprise modules (business areas) access the data defined in master data. Properly defined and maintained master data allow to handle work processes faster and simpler by means of A+W Enterprise.

**Definitions**
- **Market partners:** are customers, (building) projects, suppliers, (rack) owners, and others.
- **Article:** Describes a product with its characteristics and properties.
- **Bill of material (BOM):** Article structure including processing steps and restrictions.
- **Product group:** Alpha-numerical value. Sums up several articles. An extra large intermediate memory for huge data volumes in article master data.

> **Note**
> **System basics:** Organization and maintenance of master data are the core of the system and its modules. All business units access the same basic master data.
>
> **Bill of material (BOM):** The bill of materials describes the article structure including processing steps and forms the basis for the merchandise and production management system integrated in A+W Enterprise. A bill of material can include several articles.
>
> **Product group:** Every article has to be allocated to a product group. The product group defines the article price and is the basis for statistical analysis.
>
> **Prices and conditions:** Basis of the master data for prices and conditions are regional, national, and foreign price lists. Terms have priority over prices.

### Master data organization and maintenance
Organization and maintenance of master data are the core of the system and its modules. The data entered in article master data will influence many areas of the system. This includes document entry, production, inventory, purchasing, despatch, statistics, and data replication. All business units access the same basic master data. Apart from that, there are separate master data for the individual areas. Master data include all data, from articles up to surcharges.

This subject area includes the following training units:
- Market partners
- Article
- Bill of material (BOM)
- Product group
- Prices and conditions
- Working with Shared Memory

Model master data, i.e. a complete set of article-, bill of materials-, and product group master data can be installed with the system.

#### Market partners
**Fig. B-1: Dialog Market partners**
*(Screenshot of the Market partner dialog in A+W Enterprise.)*

The market partner structure includes customers, projects, suppliers, owners, and others. You can enter information on these market partners such as addresses, contacts, bank accounts, limits, the group they belong to, etc. Projects are normally large construction sites. There are three main functions for project handling:
- a group-wide project information system to exchange information on projects
- a project monitoring system to monitor projects, and create budgets (quantities and values)
- a project condition system for separate pricing for quotations and orders related to the project

#### Article
**Fig. B-2: Dialog - Article master data**
*(Screenshot of the Article master data dialog.)*

Article master data describe all products. Every article is described by a variety of features and properties. This includes the product name, article type, product group, existing variants, supply types, technical restrictions, and the legally stipulated product code. You can also enter article names in other languages. Bills of material describe the structure of a product which may consist of various elements. A+W Enterprise allows to include articles in a bill of material.

#### Bill of material (BOM)
Master Data > BOM

**Fig. B-3: Original article as shown in the BOM dialog**
*(Screenshot of the BOM source article selection dialog.)*

ON the BOM dialog, you can view the structure of the individual products. To start, enter the number of the product you're searching for or select it with selo.
- Use `<F3>` to jump one level deeper.
- Use `<End>` to return to the previous level.
You can only make changes on the first level on these dialogs.

*(Screenshot showing the BOM breakdown being accessed from within the Article master data screen.)*

As an integrated materials and production management system, A+W Enterprise offers an efficient bill of materials concept. BOM master data define the original article structure of every single article, or the assembly with all its elements. Addition/replacement rules allow to replace certain articles or processing steps on the product BOM. BOMs can be changed for all articles, or by customer. At document entry, you can e.g. change the BOM for a special customer and save it. The original BOM is still kept in master data. You can define in article master data whether the BOM tree may be changed at document entry. The bill of materials is the basis of materials management. It serves to determine the material required. Bills of material may have different tasks and uses, depending on whether they are applied by production sites or merchants.

**Bills of material at the distributor**
For distributors, the BOM concept offers two major advantages:
- **Pricing:** Since every BOM element (element, assembly, or processing) can be used for pricing, you can determine the total price of a product based on its components.
- **Text:** Even the product text can be automatically defined in the BOM; every BOM element can be included. Every BOM element has a print code for this purpose which is analyzed by the A+W Enterprise text generator.

**Bills of material at the producer's end**
A product consists of different elements and assemblies which have to be managed in materials management. The BOM shows all consumption material and assemblies including the corresponding quantities for this purpose. To make sure that there is a minimum stock or to guarantee the supply of stock articles, the expected material consumption has to be recognizable early on. Bills of material are the basis for the planning of quantities. Since the BOM includes all processing steps relevant for production, it is the basis for allocating the work processes to the corresponding machines. According to the just-in-time principle, the resulting default times help to find the latest possible production start date.

The following aspects form the basic function of the BOM:
- Price calculation
- Document text
- Materials management
- Organization of production control
- Production time calculation

#### Size calculation
Apart from the product structure (BOM), an article is defined by its size. For every article, you can enter size units in article master data and size calculation formulas in the BOM. Furthermore, you can enter surcharges or cutting corrections in article master data. This size calculation will be passed on to BOM elements. At document entry, the system asks for the sizes of the finished product. A+W Enterprise will automatically add surcharges and cutting corrections for production.

#### Product group
The product group structure is logical and clear. Every article has to be allocated to a product group in article master data. This way, sales statistics, turnover or article prices can be created by product group. Product groups are also essential when it comes to defining conditions.

#### Prices and conditions
Basis of the master data for prices and conditions are regional, national, and foreign price lists. You can access several price lists at once to compare calculations. Terms allow to select the correct prices, or to use other prices than the defined ones.

Terms are allocated acc. to the following hierarchy:
1. General agreements
2. Customer-/supplier-related agreements
3. Project-related agreements
4. Order/quotation-related agreements

Within these hierarchy levels, general prices and conditions (for product groups, articles, etc.) can be defined. The pricing modules offer a variety of functions to copy and change prices, based on the amount or proportional. Price lists can be automatically changed at a given date, and conditions can be limited in time. Entering price lists in foreign currencies allows to enter orders and run calculations directly in these currencies. Statistics are always kept in home currency.

#### Working with Shared Memory
Since article master data are comprehensive and thus require a lot of memory, you can store them in an interim memory (shared memory). This improves the flow of data while minimizing the loading times when several users access the database at once. The shared memory should be switched off while article master data is being changed to make sure that changes become effective immediately can be e.g. be tested at order entry.

### Exercises
All business areas access the data defined in master data. To give you an idea of what master data entail, we are going to enter a new partner and a tempered glass article in this exercise. Master data maintenance is based on a multitude of master data which have been entered earlier (e.g. colors, defined routes).

> **Trainer info:**
> In preparation of each exercise, the trainer should introduce to the participants the Partners and Articles dialogs because the complexity of master data will probably be too much for beginners. This introduction should also point out the fields to be changed in this exercise, and the operation of the dialogs.

#### Exercise 1: Enter a market partner
> **Trainer info:**
> In preparation of the exercise, the trainer should introduce to the participants the partner to be used as the master, pointing out and explaining the fields to be changed.

Entering a market partner is time-consuming and complex. This is why we are going to copy and paste an existing market partner.

### Master Data - Overview
Master data is changed only occasionally, if ever. It is the core of the entire system and is linked to all other areas. The goal of master data management is to create a single, continuous data stock for all applications in use.

### Market Partner
The market partner master data stores all customer, project, and supplier-related details, as well as one-time data (partner type Other).
The details range from entries of the company address to supplier addresses, routes, payment terms, and assessments.

#### Market partner header
After you have opened the dialog, you first have to select the market partner in the header area.
The contents of the individual tabs always relate to the market partner selected in the header.

**Fig. B-7: Market partner - header**
*(Screenshot of the market partner header section in the UI.)*

In A+W Enterprise the following market partner types are distinguished:
- Customer
- Supplier
- Other
- Project
- Owner (racks)

**Partner type**
Toggle field for market partner type. The following options are available for selection:
- **Customer:** The customer master data includes all customer-related details, including the customer-specific article definitions. You need market partners of the type Customer especially when entering sales transactions.
- **Supplier:** The supplier master data includes all supplier-related details, including supplier-specific article details. You need market partners of the type Supplier especially when entering procurement transactions. Suppliers can be entered directly in orders and in the article master data as supplier for articles to be ordered.
- **Other:** Usually One-time customers are kept under this type, for whom only the address is created. Within the expanded internal client separation, the companies are created as Other.
- **Project:** A project normally refers to a larger building project. Definitions of a technical nature, conditions of a price nature (PU and SA), and other business agreements (quantities, time, etc.) are summarized under this term. This includes a planning and an informational component. Projects can be assigned market partners, sales and purchasing transactions.
- **Owners:** Owners of racks.
