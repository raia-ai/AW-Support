---

## 1. Installation of A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service

The following installation instructions assume that there is no previous version installed.

An update of an earlier release version of the A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service is executed precisely like a new installation.

An update of an earlier version of the B2B Service, e.g. from ALCIB 2011 B2B Service to A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service is not possible. Only one version of the B2B Service should be installed.

This document describes only the installation and configuration of the A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service. In case of questions about the installation or configuration of dependent set-ups/disk sets, please see the installation instructions for these products.

### 1.1 Overview and the basics

The following list provides an overview of the work that must be done during installation:

-   Installation and configuration of the Informix driver via `setnet32.exe`
-   Creation of the necessary set-ups/disk sets
    -   A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service
    -   A+W Infrastructure 6 Collector Services
    -   A+W Infrastructure 6 Middleware
    -   Java 7 Update 51
    -   A+W Setup Launcher
-   Installation of the B2B Service and the dependent disk sets with the Setup Launcher
-   Configuration of the B2B Service with the Config Tool

### 1.2 Time requirement

If all requirements are checked and fulfilled, the following times are required for the installation and the conversion of the existing data:

#### 1.2.1 Installation time for the software

Depending on the computer, storage space, and configuration, the installation times will vary for different computers. The installation time specified was determined using a reference device with the following characteristics:
-   Processor: 3000 Mhz
-   RAM: 4 GB
-   Other: /

For an initial or new installation, an installation time of 5 minutes must be anticipated for the reference device. For higher or lower-power hardware, shorter or longer installation times must be anticipated.

### 1.3 Requirements

#### 1.3.1 Windows Server Version

Supported operating systems:
-   Windows 2008 Server R2 32/64bit.
-   Windows 2012 Server R2 32/64bit.

#### 1.3.2 Network

For the installation itself, no network access is necessary.
For the operation of the service, there must be a connection to the A+W Enterprise DB Server and the company network.

#### 1.3.3 Software

It is assumed that the following disk sets were already installed and configured BEFORE the installation of the A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service disk set.

-   Informix Client SDK 3.5 TC9 (or newer)
-   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 SDK

For the operation of the A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service, access to an installed A+W ERP Web Service 6 is required. This must absolutely be installed on the same computer as the B2B Service.

-   A+W ERP Web Service 6

### 1.4 Procedure

For the installation, please proceed in the following sequence:

1.  Use `setnet32.exe` to configure the database server and hosts. This assumes that an IBM Informix Client SDK was installed (see software requirements).
2.  Installation of the A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service with the Setup Launcher.
    On the **Component Selection** dialog on the A+W Enterprise node, select the "A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service" module. This automatically selects all dependent set-ups.
    
    *(Image of A+W SetupLauncher Component Selection dialog, showing "A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service" selected.)*

3.  After the successful installation, the B2B Service is configured with the Config Tool.

---

## 2. Configuration with the Config Tool

### 2.1 Common Settings

This is the first dialog in the configuration process.

*(Image of A+W Enterprise 6 B2B Service Configuration - Common Settings dialog)*

#### 2.1.1 Polling Interval

In the **Polling Interval (Seconds)** field, set the number of seconds that the service waits before it checks the `ottransfer` transfer table again for new data records. The default value is 60 seconds.

#### 2.1.2 Internal Invoice/Dispatch Transfer

If this checkbox is active, the B2B Service processes `ottransfer` entries with interface = `INVOIC` or `DELIVE`. (This handles the logic of internal calculation, and creation of INVOICE and DISPATCHNOTIFICATION documents in AW extended openTRANS format).

#### 2.1.3 Dorma Orders

If this checkbox is active, the B2B service processes `ottransfer` entries with interface = `INVOIC` (for Dorma P.O.).

#### 2.1.4 openTRANS Document Export

If this checkbox is active, the B2B Service processes the `ottransfer` entries with = `OTDOC` (user-specific export of openTRANS documents).

#### 2.1.5 A+W EDI Export (P.O. export)

If this checkbox is active, the B2B Service processes `ottransfer` entries with interface = `EDIEXP` (A+W standard export).

#### 2.1.6 Export of E-Invoice

If this checkbox is active, the B2B Service processes `ottransfer` entries with interface = `E-INV` (export of electronic invoices).

#### 2.1.7 Protocol-Button

With the **Protocol** button, you can open the **Protocol Configuration** dialog. This automatically selects all dependent set-ups. On the first tab, the trace categories for the frontend are configured; on the following tabs, the tracing of dependent modules and programs can be activated if necessary.

*(Image of Protocol Configuration dialog)*

The following trace levels are distinguished:
-   Fatal
-   Error
-   Warning
-   Info
-   Debug

If, for example, the **Info** level is active, trace messages of the type **Error** and **Warning** will also be written into the tracing file.

The tracing file is always in the directory `%ProgramData%\A+W\Log`. The file name consists of the service name, the current date, and the process number, and ends with `.awtrc`.

The A+W Enterprise B2B Service currently uses no log protocol.

### 2.2 ERP Webservice Settings

This dialog only opens if at least one of the **Internal Invoice/Dispatch Transfer** or **Dorma Orders** checkboxes were activated in the Common Settings.

*(Image of ERP Webservice Settings dialog)*

#### 2.2.1 ERP Web Service URL

Enter the URL for the ERP Web Service.

#### 2.2.2 Export Path

Enter the Root path in which the exported openTRANS xml files are saved. The internal logic completes the directory `<site number>` and `<customer number>` in the path specified here.

The exported file is saved with the name: `openTRANS_<process type>_<site number>_<customer number>_<process number>_<process sub-number>.xml`

**Example:**
If the file export path `D:\openTRANS` is entered in the Config tool, the created openTRANS invoice file of invoice 776655 for customer 1234 in site 10 is saved in:
`D:\openTRANS\10\1234\openTRANS_INVOICE_10_1234_776655_0.xml`

If errors occur during the creation of the export file, the records remain in the table `ottransfer` with an error flag. The A+W Enterprise B2B Service currently uses no log protocol. If for some reason the file generation for a transaction is started again even though a file has already been generated, the existing file is overwritten by the newly-generated one.

### 2.3 Cantor Export â€“ openTRANS 2.1 Settings

This dialog only opens if the **openTRANS Document Export** checkbox was activated in the Common Settings.

*(Image of Cantor Export - openTRANS 2.1 Settings dialog)*

#### 2.3.1 Active

The checkbox enables the export.

#### 2.3.2 Export Root Path

Enter here the basic path in which the export files are saved. Below this basic path, the B2B Service automatically creates sub-directories for site numbers and customer numbers in which the export files are saved.

### 2.4 Hornbach export â€“ openTRANS 2.1 settings

This dialog only opens if the **openTRANS Document Export** checkbox was activated in the Common Settings.

*(Image of Hornbach Export - openTRANS 2.1 Settings dialog)*

#### 2.4.1 Active

The checkbox enables the export.

#### 2.4.2 Export Root Path

Enter here the basic path in which the export files are saved. Below this basic path, the B2B Service automatically creates sub-directories for site numbers and customer numbers in which the export files are saved.

### 2.5 A+W EDI Export Settings

This dialog only opens if the **A+W EDI Export** checkbox was activated in the Common Settings.

*(Image of A+W EDI Export Settings dialog)*

#### 2.5.1 Active

The checkbox enables the export.

#### 2.5.2 Export Root Path

Enter here the basic path in which the export files are saved. Below this basic path, the B2B Service automatically creates sub-directories for site numbers and supplier numbers in which the export files are saved.

This configuration can be overridden by a supplier-specific configuration in A+W Enterprise. For a detailed description of overriding, see the configuration document "A+W Enterprise EDI."

### 2.6 E-Invoice Export Settings

This dialog only opens if the **E-Invoice Export** checkbox was activated in the Common Settings.

*(Image of E-Invoice Export Settings dialog)*

#### 2.6.1 Active

The checkbox enables the export.
