long_description: "This document provides a detailed functional description of A+W iCut (EL), a software solution by A+W Software GmbH. A+W iCut (EL) is a 2-station system designed for small companies that manage their glass cutting processes manually. It facilitates order entry for various glass types (insulated, LAMI, TG, single glass), optimization of cutting plans, and control of standard cutting tables. The software includes features for managing stock, handling residual plates, and calculating cutting dimensions for standard shapes. It offers two working modes: a standard mode for quick processing and an expert mode for detailed control over optimization. The document outlines the system's core functions, requirements (Windows 10/Server 2019, .NET Framework 3.5), optional enhancements like the A+W Barcode Manager, and notable limitations, such as the lack of support for advanced processing, price calculation, or integration with external production systems. It also lists modules that are not compatible with A+W iCut (EL)."

## Performance Description

### Data
| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | A+W iCut (EL) |
| **Module number** | 235001, 235002 |
| **Module** | A+W iCut (EL) |
| **Brief description** | Integrated optimization and cutting software for small companies |
| **Available** | July 2020 |

### Description
A+W iCut (EL) is a 2-station system (in the office and at the cutting table) for order entry, optimization, and cutting control. The target group for A+W iCut (EL) is small companies that organize their cutting primarily manually and using production documents. A+W iCut (EL) allows the input of orders without price calculation for insulated glass, LAMI, TG, and single glass including edge processings and standard shapes. The system manages the optimization and cutting. In addition, A+W iCut (EL) allows stock management and residual plate control.

The optimization can be done both in chaotic and in sorted mode. Broken sheets can be re-optimized manually. The printing of labels and visualization of cutting plans can be done on the cutting table.

A+W iCut (EL) offers 2 working modes:
-   **Standard mode:** in this mode, the optimization process and production release are done with a mouse-click.
-   **Expert mode:** this mode allows control of the individual planning and optimization steps and thus also the optimization result.

### Requirements
-   Windows 10 or Server 2019
-   Microsoft.NET Framework 3.5

### List of functions
A+W iCut (EL) supports the following functions and processes:
-   **Order entry**
    -   Entry of IG, LAMI, TG, and single sheets
    -   Entry of edge processings (for calculation of the correct cutting dimensions)
    -   Entry of standard shapes from the A+W shape catalog
    -   Calculation of the total order price based on manually input item prices
    -   DXF import for the order entry with shape 99
-   **Stock**
    -   Manual stock receipt bookings (no purchasing module)
    -   Automatic stock removals by the optimization
-   **Optimization/use of residual plates**
    -   The system offers the opportunity to create and maintain a stock for residual plates
    -   Residual plates can be added manually to the residual plate stock
    -   The optimization primarily uses the stock sheets that provide the "best result" with regard to costs and yield, and only then the residual plates
    -   If the use of a residual plate is desired despite poorer yield or costs, this can be controlled manually (priority)
-   **Control of standard cutting tables**
    -   The system offers the data transfer and control of cutting tables
    -   Only commonly used standard cutting tables are supported. Please contact A+W Sales before the project (during the quotation phase) in order to ensure that the machine type you are using is supported.
    -   Edge stripping for IG is supported

### Optional enhancements of the basic module
-   **A+W Barcode Manager (EL)**
    A+W iCut (EL) supports data exchange with the A+W Barcode Manager (EL). You can use this module to report breaks and defects and then to optimize.
    -   230101 A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Basic license
    -   230102 A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Concurrent user license
    -   230105 A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Glass Remake Manager

    -   It is not possible to transmit data for the graphic display of production steps to A+W Production Terminal or A+W Production sTerminal (EL).
    -   It is not possible to transmit the optimized cutting patterns to the A+W Realtime Optimizer.

The A+W Business Barcode Manager (EL) can only make product and main process-specific bookings. A booking of sub-parts is not possible.

-   230015 Delivery Check I
-   230121 Quote Optimization
-   230035 Door Order Entry: Fitting and Processings

### Notes
A+W iCut (EL) must be regarded independently of earlier A+W products. In particular, A+W iCut (EL) is not an upgrade product from earlier production solutions (such as ALFERT or XOPT2000, for example). Thus it cannot be guaranteed that all function characteristics of earlier products are available in this product.

A+W iCut (EL) allows an upgrade to a A+W Business PRO with the same master data.

Project work (configuration, training, reports and labels, ...) by A+W requires approx. 5-7 man-days.
