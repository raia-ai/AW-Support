## Tutorial

### Overview

The target group of this training session concerning the A+W Production module are employees who are working at different stations (machines and registration points) within production.

The benefit for the customers is that they can directly control their machines. There are no downtimes due to having to digitalize a shape at a processing machine. It is furthermore not necessary to enter any NC codes at the machine which also means continuous machine deployment.

> **The functions depend on the enabled modules**
> Please note that the individual functions are available only if the corresponding modules and interfaces have been installed and enabled.
> If you detect functions in this description that are not available in your version, please contact A+W Software GmbH.

#### Tutorial Structure

This tutorial consists of subjects with several training modules each. Each module consists of the following elements:

*   **Overview**: Each training module starts with an overview of the major topics:
    *   Objectives: What shall be conveyed?
    *   Benefit: What can this knowledge be used for?
    *   Maxims: Which correlations are to be remembered?
*   **Concepts**: First, the concepts and terms of the corresponding training module will be explained. This is followed by examples and instructions.

### Basic Ideas

This documentation shall give you an idea of the Barcoding process and module in A+W Production and a basic understanding of this subject. Moreover, we will explain the basics of A+W Production, the tools used, and the general possibilities and limits.

We strongly recommend referring to detailed documentation on control stations (production terminals), internal A+W Production installation and configuration instructions, scanner installation, configuration, etc. These subjects will be mentioned in this documentation, but not handled in detail. A clear restriction of the areas is not always possible, and not required either.

These instructions are not a substitute for basic knowledge about production structures, the production terminals used, scanners or other A+W software.

#### Document structure

This documentation describes general knowledge on A+W Production. What is A+W Production, the most important components, registration points, which scanner types are used, procedures, etc.

#### Barcoding

A+W Production is a general term for collecting current data about statuses and processes in companies.

It gathers the flow of production at the most important places within production, the so-called registration points, and thus maps the process flow of your production. This is achieved by means of, e.g. barcodes, scanners, Production Terminals (control stations), etc. Directly or indirectly, the gathered data is transferred to an appropriate collection point (AWPort) and saved in the database (A+W Production DB).

#### Purpose of A+W Production

First of all, A+W Production is used to display the current situation. Starting from determining the production status of an order, and tracking the product through production to displaying the performance.

In the case of rejects, apart from the registration point, the reject reason is entered. Corresponding subsequent parts can be created automatically, depending on the configuration. Machine control is also executed automatically based on barcode readings.

Another important aspect of A+W Production are the statistical analyses. You can analyze the productivity and machine times, monitor production mistakes (e.g. reject) and are provided with quality assurance thanks to the batch data collection.

A+W Discovery enables you to create long-term analyses that are available for future planning.

### Booking Elements

This subject shows you how to handle the different objects of A+W Production.

This includes the following training modules:
*   "Products"
*   "Booking Places"
*   "Racks"
*   "Staff"
*   "Status"

#### Products

**Objectives**
*   Getting familiar with objects of A+W Production.
*   What can and what cannot be tracked.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct objects** | Have a barcode and are booked directly. |
| **Indirect objects** | Do not have a barcode because they are automatically included when booked. |

**Note**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Traceable products** | All parts of a bill of materials onto which a barcode can be applied. |
| **Single lite A+W Production** | Every BOM element is identified by its own barcode. |
| **Quantity A+W Production** | All parts of a BOM element have the same barcode. |

#### Basics

A+W Production differentiates between two object types:
*   Direct objects
*   Indirect objects

**Direct objects**

Direct objects are those that have a barcode and can be booked directly. They include:
*   Registration points (places, trucks and machines)
*   Racks and boxes
*   Lites and units
*   Status values / statuses
*   Employees

**Indirect objects**

Indirect objects are those that are automatically included when booked. They include:
*   Processing
*   Batch information

**Lites or Units**

Lites and units are traceable products. These are always all the parts of a bill of materials onto which a barcode can be affixed. Example: Single lite, IG, LAMI, frame, muntin, etc.

In single lite A+W Production (default), every BOM element is identified by a unique barcode. This enables you to determine the exact location and status of a part.

In quantity A+W Production, all parts of a BOM element have the same barcode. As a result, it is no longer possible to determine the exact location and status of a part. Here, quantity statements are only made in relation to production statuses. Accordingly, the booking effort is a lot less.

In contrast to the aforementioned parts, there are parts that cannot be tracked. These include, e.g. gas, butyl, silicone, foils, etc.

To get an optimum data basis, it is therefore essential to book single lites/units to the corresponding registration point or rack in Production.

#### Booking types

We distinguish between three booking types:
*   **Movement bookings:** Movement bookings record the change of location of a rack, unit or lite. This may be a rack (e.g. unit on rack) or a registration point (rack or unit on registration point).
*   **Processing bookings:** Processing bookings register processing steps (e.g. drilling) for units.
*   **Status bookings (e.g. rejects, maintenance):** Status bookings represent the change of status of an object.

Processing and status bookings can also be triggered implicitly, through movement bookings.

Naturally, reject registration is important in this connection. Apart from the registration point and other information, the reject reason is entered. Subsequent parts can be generated automatically, depending on the configuration.

The gathered data can be used for analysis, statistics, and inventory purposes, among other things (e.g. barcode reports, MS-Excel, etc.). It is used for production control, lite/unit and rack tracking and many other purposes.

**Additional Information**
*   See "Reject Management"
*   See "Barcode Reporting"
*   See "Scanning Units"

#### Booking Places

**Objectives**
*   Acquire knowledge about the *Registration Points* dialog.
*   Getting familiar with and understanding the *Error Rack* registration point.
*   Getting familiar with and understanding the *Dispatch* registration point.

**Benefits**
In order to avoid booking mistakes, it is necessary to observe the correct booking order.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **RP** | Short for registration point |
| **Registration points** | Stations within production or dispatch. |
| **Error rack** | An internal registration point with the registration point number 12 and is filled automatically. This registration point will include all units which - because of errors - have lost their allocation to a physical rack or a physical registration point. |
| **Trigger time** | The time defined in the system which determines the point in time from which the truck load is considered to be shipped. It is enabled by the status booking `<Start> <Truck>`. The time can be configured in the system. |

**Note**
Registration points have a unique number and a name.

##### Registration Points

All stations within production (production areas, trucks, machines) that are equipped with scanners and/or Production Terminals are called registration points (RP). They have a unique number and a name.

A machine does not necessarily have to be one registration point. It can also be subdivided into several registration points.

**Example: IG line**
*   1611 > machine entry,
*   1610 > the machine itself and
*   1612 > machine exit.

Splitting machines into several registration points allows detailed production tracking and analysis.

You can book racks, products and statuses to these registration points. The more registration points you have, the more detailed your analyses will be.

*[Image: Screenshot of the Registration Points dialog, showing a table with columns for ID, Name, Description, Type, and Machine No. The bottom half shows detailed fields for a selected registration point like "Registration Point No.", "Barcode", "Name", and checkboxes for "Feedback of Bookings".]*

The table above shows which registration points have already been created. You can create new registration points or change already created registration points.

The checkboxes in the *Feedback of Bookings* section are for production feedback that are used to update the current order status in the upper-level order processing system.

> **Column headers can be configured as desired**
> The headers of the individual columns can be configured as desired. It is therefore possible that the headers shown here do not correspond to the headers in your installation.

##### Error rack

The error rack is an internal registration point. This registration point will include all units which - because of errors - have lost their allocation to a physical rack or a physical registration point.

The internal registration point *Error Rack* has registration point number 12.

Registration point 12 follows the same rules as any other registration point (reports, bookings, corrections, etc.).

Basically, there are two rules for the *Error Rack* registration point:
*   **Rule 1:** The error rack should always be empty!
*   **Rule 2:** If the error rack is not empty, there must be an operation or scanner error.

**How do units get onto the error rack?**

There are several reasons. Apart from a defective scanner/label, this is usually due to operating errors by the staff.

The error rack is used whenever a registration point or rack is scanned with the status `<Start>` while according to A+W Production, this object still holds units. These units are automatically assigned to the Error Rack registration point.

**Possible causes:**

*   **Example 1:**
    Several racks are being used at a registration point. A physical rack has been registered with the scanner; units are booked to this rack `<Rack 1> <Unit 1> <Unit 2>`. When changing to the second rack, the user forgets to scan/register this rack. The units are actually placed onto rack 2 but booked to the wrong rack, namely rack 1.
    If rack 1, which has been correctly loaded, is processed as usual during the production process, this rack will be empty and ready for other tasks.
    According to the scanning rules, rack 1 will be scanned with `<Start> <Rack1>` next time. This resets the rack in barcoding to empty.
    Internally (according to bookings), rack 1 still held the erroneously scanned (allocated) units from rack 2 (see above). These units are automatically booked to the *Error Rack* registration point.

*   **Example 2:**
    A truck is loaded correctly. When all units, racks, and boxes have been loaded, the truck should get the status Shipped `<Shipped><Truck1>`. This is omitted. The truck delivers the goods and is available (empty) for the next transport on the next day.
    According to the scanning rules, it is registered for loading by `<Start><Truck1>`, and reset (empty).
    As the truck is still considered loaded (according to bookings) because of the missing `<Shipped>` booking of the previous day, its entire load is booked to registration point 12 (Error Rack) by the `<Start>` status booking.

*   **Example 3:**
    A loaded rack is unloaded without being scanned, or scanned by a defective scanner. Physically, the rack is empty, but according to barcoding, it is still loaded. The next time the rack is used, in adherence to the scanning rules `<Start><Rack>`, these units will be booked to registration point 12, Error Rack.

**Removing units from the error rack**

The error rack is an internal registration point. As on any other registration point, units on this rack can be changed by new bookings.

There are two methods of booking units from one registration point (in this case the error rack) to another registration point/rack.

1.  **The manual method** is carried out via the *Production Terminal Edit*. You must execute the changes to the registration point (of the rack) manually by using the *Production Terminal Edit*.
2.  **The automatic method** corrects an error automatically by another correct booking during the production process.

> **Tip**
> Check the internal registration point 12 (Error Rack) regularly, and make corrections right away. Apart from the *Production Terminal Edit*, the Barcode Manager reports are available for checking purposes.
> â¨ See "Barcode Reporting"
> Please remember: from the barcoding point of view, this is a registration point. You can use the same functions and tools for analyses and corrections as for any other registration point!

> **Many units on the error rack**
> If there are many units on the internal registration point 12 *Error Rack*, please contact the A+W customer service. A+W will analyze the reasons together with you and work out a customized and practical solution.

**Correct booking**

Units moved to the internal registration point 12, *Error Rack*, will be automatically removed from the *Error Rack* with the next correct booking of these units at another registration point. They will be assigned to this registration point/rack and vanish from the *Error Rack* registration point.

**Example:**
A loaded rack is unloaded without being scanned, or scanned by a defective scanner. Physically, the rack is empty, but according to barcoding, it is still loaded. The next time the rack is used complying with the scanning rules `<Start> <Rack>`, these units will be booked to the Error Rack (only applies to units which have not been registered again in the meantime, see below!).

Prerequisite for automatic correction is that the units are still being produced and will be scanned during further processing.

Every scan allocates the unit to the corresponding registration point/rack; the unit automatically vanishes from the internal registration point 12, Error Rack.

5.  Click on the icon button [Save] to save the entries.

**Additional information**
*   â¨ See Software Reference, "Registration Points"

#### Truck registration point

Each truck is a registration point which follows the same rules as any other registration point. An exception is the emptying of a truck via barcodes. Objects (racks/boxes, etc.) usually leave a registration point by being registered at another registration point. This does not make sense for trucks, for practical reasons. It would have to be scanned when the units are unloaded, e.g. at the construction site.

The objects must be booked off this registration point and transferred to the internal registration point 11 (Off Site) by means of another barcode mechanism. However, this booking must be made only after the truck has been returned fully unloaded!

To avoid a complex technical structure with scanners at the gates, the booking to registration point 11 (Off Site) is made after a time period defined in the system, when the truck is registered after its return by `<Start><Truck>`.

The time period is triggered by scanning the status `<Shipped> <Truck>` for the corresponding truck and/or its load.

Within this time period, the load is considered as not shipped and is still booked to registration point `<Truck>` with status `<Shipped>`. Only after a START registration, AFTER a defined period, the registration point changes to 11.

The status booking `<Start><Truck>` would reset the truck and/or the racks, and move the units involved to the error rack!

After the defined time period, all units are considered to be shipped, and are booked to the internal registration point 11 with status `<Shipped>`; the racks and/or the truck can be used again in the production process.

#### Racks

**Objectives**
*   Acquire knowledge about the *Racks* dialog.
*   Getting familiar with and understanding the booking process.

**Benefits**
In order to understand barcoding, you must know what can be booked to the racks.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rack types** | Rack types in barcoding include A racks, L racks, harp racks, boxes and the specific racks for furnace beds and autoclaves. |

**Note**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Book rack** | When a rack is booked to a registration point, all units on the rack will be automatically booked to this registration point as well. |
| **Create racks** | Racks can be created in the master data manually or automatically. |
| **Book** | You can book products or statuses to racks. |
| **Where is a rack located** | A rack is always located at one location (registration point). |
| **Boxes** | Boxes are not returned to the production cycle. |

##### Racks

Use this section to create racks for A+W Production. The following rack types are available:
*   A racks
*   L racks
*   Harp racks
*   Boxes

At some registration points, special racks are required. These are usually the furnaces and autoclaves.

You can book products or statuses to the racks. A rack is always located at one location in production (registration point).

*[Image: Screenshot of the Racks dialog, showing a list of existing racks and fields to define new racks or view properties of a selected rack.]*

The screenshot above shows which racks have already been created. You can create new racks or change already created racks.

##### Filter racks

If you have a large quantity of racks, you can create filters to restrict the displayed racks. You can see in the upper section of the dialog whether a filter has been set.
If a filter has been set, the following is displayed: `Caution: The rack filter is set!`
If no filter has been set, the following is displayed: `No rack filter set`

In order to activate a filter, click on the button [Filter]. The *Rack filter* dialog opens in which you can define and activate the corresponding filter.

> **Column headers can be configured as desired**
> The headers of the individual columns can be configured as desired. It is therefore possible that the headers shown here do not correspond to the headers in your installation.

##### Boxes

At first, boxes are treated like racks but they are not returned to the production cycle. It is therefore useful to use a separate number area for the barcodes.

This barcode area should always be printed and used up completely. This ensures that a barcode cannot be used several times in Production simultaneously.

You can, of course, also print and use up a succession of several smaller areas, e.g. 9000-9099 followed by 9100-9199, 9200-9299, etc., but you should always use the entire number area up to 9999.

The booking history for the boxes still remains expressive if the area is used to its full extent and barcodes repeat themselves after quite a long time.

> **Creating barcodes**
> Always use the report for barcode creation. Alternatively, barcodes can be supplied by a Microsoft Word document.

#### Staff

**Objectives**
*   Acquire knowledge about the *Employees* dialog.
*   Getting familiar with and understanding how to manage employees.
*   Create and edit employees

**Benefits**
You can define different cost rates for each employee. This enables you to take a closer look at personnel costs. In addition, you can analyze how many employees were involved in processing.

**Note**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Create employees** | An employee must first be created before he can log on at a station. |
| **Registered person** | Is included with the booking. This is the employee responsible for the booking. The registered person remains registered until another name barcode is scanned. |
| **Registration mandatory** | The scanner and A+W Production data can be set so that user registration is mandatory. |

#### Employees

All employees in your company who work with A+W Production must be registered. After an employee has been registered, he can log on at the individual stations. His name is then automatically included in the individual bookings and he is the employee responsible for this booking.

*[Image: Screenshot of the Employees dialog, showing a list of employees with columns for ID, Name, Key, Description, and Barcode.]*

The table above shows which employees have already been created. You can create new employees or change already created employees.

You can define different cost rates for each employee. This enables you to take a closer look at the respective personnel costs.

In addition, it is possible that several employees are registered for one station. Accordingly, you will know how many employees were involved in processing.

You will find a detailed description of the individual fields in the software reference.

#### Status

**Objectives**
*   Acquire knowledge about the *Status Values* dialog.
*   Getting familiar with and understanding different status values

**Benefits**
In order to obtain meaningful analyses, a certain booking discipline must be adhered to.

**Definitions**

| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status values** | Describe the status of an object |
| **Machine status** | Ready, off, malfunction, maintenance, break, ... |
| **Product status** | Reject, deficiency, ... |
| **Rack status** | Empty, ready, shipped, ... |
| **Registration point status** | Ready, shipped, empty, ... |
| **Action status** | OK, abort, accept, ... |

**Note**
Work interruptions must always be logged.

#### Status values

Recording the actual object status within production is the basic principle of A+W Production.

In order to obtain meaningful data analyses, the master data must be maintained and it is absolutely necessary to book data (quantities and objects) correctly and promptly.

Status values affect the following A+W Production objects:
*   Unit/group
*   Rack
*   Registration points
*   Staff

**Unit/group**
The purpose of this is to enter the status of a lite and/or unit or a product. The following status values are available for example:
*   Not yet produced
*   Reject
*   Defect
*   Ready for shipment

**Rack**
The purpose of this is to enter the status of a rack. Racks can have the following statuses, for example:
*   Empty
*   Full
*   Off site
*   Ready for shipment

**Registration point**
The purpose of this is to enter the status of a registration point. Registration points can have the following statuses for example:
*   Start
*   To
*   Off

It may be necessary to interrupt work at a registration point during an ongoing production process. These interruptions must always be logged.

Possible reasons for an interruption:
*   Machine maintenance
*   Machine failure
*   Breaks
*   Set-up times

**Action barcode**
Apart from entering the aforementioned status values, it is also possible to scan different actions. They include, e.g.:
*   OK
*   Cancel
*   Rotate
*   Next row

*[Image: Screenshot of the Status Values dialog, showing a list of statuses like Breakage, Defect, Start, ReadyForDelivery, etc.]*

The table above shows which status values have already been created. You can create new status values or change already created status values.

> **Column headers can be configured as desired**
> The headers of the individual columns can be configured as desired. It is therefore possible that the headers shown here do not correspond to the headers in your installation.

### Data Entry

This subject shows you the methods and locations for entering data in production.
This includes the following training modules:
*   "Scanner"
*   "Barcodes"

#### Scanner

**Objectives**
*   Getting familiar with different scanners
*   Getting to know and understanding their functionality
*   The scanner configurations

**Benefits**
Using scanners will assist you in substantially reducing your workload and it saves time.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Online scanners** | Do not have any memory and the scanner data must be directly transmitted to the connected system. If the connection is interrupted, scanned data will be lost. |
| **Offline scanners** | Have a memory which can temporarily save the scanned data and transfers it when connected with the system. |
| **Serial scanners** | Are used at the terminals, for example. The scanner will not save information temporarily, i.e. without connection to the network, data will be lost. |

**Note**
Apart from their operating system, scanners need software that performs the required functions.

##### Scanner Types

In barcoding, different scanner types are used. Basically, there are online and offline scanners. Scanner selection is highly individual and depends on a variety of factors, e.g.:
*   How many scanners with different logs shall be used?
*   Where shall the scanners be used?
*   Which operating radius do they have to cover?

There are further factors that need to be discussed with the customer directly on site.

**Online scanners**
Online scanners include the line scanners and serial scanners which normally have no memory so that they have to transfer the scanned data directly to the connected system. If the connection is interrupted, scanned data will be lost.

**Denso scanners (WLAN)**
These scanners are WLAN-enabled and communicate directly with AWPort. They have a display and a buffer system for buffering data. Notifications to users can be sent via the built-in display and the scanner's menu structure. If the data transfer is interrupted (e.g. outside the range of the receiving station), data will be temporarily saved in the scanner and transferred when the connection has been re-established. These scanners are used in the shipping area, for instance.

*[Image: Denso online scanner]*

**Serial scanners**
The serial scanners are used at the *Production Terminals* or in connection with *AWPort-Light* as free online scanners. In connection with the *Production Terminals*, they are normally allocated to a fixed registration point (configurable) and replace the keyboard. Bookings are made by the connected *Production Terminal*.

With *AWPort Light*, these scanners can be used as free online scanners wherever a *Production Terminal* is not required. These scanners are robust and reasonably priced. However, they do not have a display or a temporary memory. Notifications to users can be issued only to a certain extent. As these scanners normally do not have a buffer system, scanned data will be lost if the data transfer is interrupted (e.g. outside the range of the receiving station).

**Offline scanners**
The use of offline scanners in an A+W Production environment is subject to special restrictions. Offline scanners are barcode readers that collect barcode registrations and transfer them together at a later stage. As the transfer usually has to be released manually, data registered via offline scanners will be analyzed (much) later than that collected by online scanners. These scanners require well-organized and disciplined working!

##### The scanner configurations

Scanner configurations are multi-layered. Apart from their operating system, scanners need software that performs the required functions. This software is supplied by A+W and has to be transferred to the scanner and configured there.

Furthermore, scanners have to be registered with the A+W Production system.

The necessary configuration steps are usually performed by A+W but can also be executed by specially trained staff.

> **Scanners in practice**
> Currently, WLAN scanners type BHT800BW are deployed almost exclusively. The advantage of this type is that the collected data is always available online.

> **Documentation of configuration**
> Documentation, including the customized configuration, is part of the project planning phase; it will be saved and kept on the customer's computer.

#### Barcodes

Scanners usually require barcodes. Every person, registration point, rack, etc. gets a unique number which is encoded as a barcode for the scanner. These numbers are defined jointly by A+W Software GmbH and the customer during the project planning phase. These barcodes are provided, for example, by an A+W Production report.

Should you need new barcodes for persons, registration points, or racks/boxes, start the report and print the required barcodes.

### Booking Examples

This subject shows you how to book correctly.
This includes the following training modules:
*   "Scanning Sequence"
*   "Scanning Units"
*   "Scanning in Dispatch"
*   "Scanning Registration Points"
*   "Truck Registration Point"
*   "Scanning Racks and/or Boxes"
*   "Scanning the Status"
*   "Correcting Erroneous Entries"

#### Scanning Sequence

The following examples shall describe the scanning sequence to be obeyed. To keep the examples quite clear, we have refrained from showing the entire display chain, i. e. we assume that when units are scanned, the scanner has been registered at a registration point, the user has scanned his personal barcode, etc. The total scanning sequence is the combination of the listed examples, and depends on the registration point.

When scanning, first of all, the scanner is always prepared for scanning by registering the person working with it (optional), registering the registration point at the scanner, followed by the other bookings, normally rack registration.

Registration of the person, registration point, scanning the status, etc. only affects all future bookings such as scanning a unit which is then saved in the system with all this information by ALCIM Booking.

**Scanning sequence:**

1.  The user operating the scanner should scan his personal barcode at the start of his shift/scanning. This information will be saved with every scan and serves for analysis purposes later. If this barcode is not scanned, a configurable default value will be saved in the database. A (new) name barcode can be scanned anytime, even after the scanner has been registered at the registration point, e.g. when the operator at a registration point changes.
2.  The registration point where the scanner is used must always be known to the scanner. Every section, machine, truck registered as a registration point has its own barcode. These can be: cutting, IG line 1, IG line 2, furnace, dispatch, truck 1, truck 2, etc.
3.  The rack (box) where the units are stacked has to be scanned, i.e. registered with the scanner. If there are several racks at the registration point, you always have to scan the rack to be currently loaded. Exception: In Dispatch, units are also booked directly to the registration point (truck) (see also Special case truck).
4.  The units: After items 1-3 have been scanned, the units to be stacked or those whose status has changed (e.g. reject report) are scanned.

**Description**
`<Text>` the text in pointed brackets shows the barcode to be scanned (registration point, rack, status, unit, etc.).
The row `<Begin> <Rack> <Unit1> <Unit2> <Unit3 ...>` means: Scan the status `<Begin>`, then the rack `<Rack>` onto which the units should be placed and then all units `<Unit>` in the order in which they should be placed on this rack.

> **Caution with barcode <Begin>**
> The barcode `<Begin>` always resets the rack, box, truck, etc. to empty on the barcode side (reset)! If there were still units present according to barcoding, e.g. on the rack, they will be assigned to the *Error Rack* registration point (see Error Rack)!
> These remaining units according to barcoding can only occur because of forgotten scans, incorrect labels (incorrect readings), etc.!

#### Scanning Units

This module shows you how to scan units.

**How to scan a unit to an empty rack (rack will be emptied by barcoding)**

1.  Register an empty rack with the scanner: `<Begin> <Rack>`
    *[Image: Barcode for "begin" and a transport rack]*

**Additional information**
*   â¨ See "Lites or Units"

#### Scanning in Dispatch

Dispatch needs special attention with regard to barcoding. There are units, racks, boxes, etc. at this registration point, but also trucks which are registration points as well, and form the last link in the production chain. Usually, Denso online scanners are used here.

**General procedure:**

1.  First scan the name tag (it can be scanned again any time)
    `<Schmidt>`
    *[Image: "HELLO, MY NAME IS: Schmidt" name tag]*

2.  Register the registration point with the scanner. Then scan *Dispatch Area* from the list.
    *   `<Dispatch Area>`
    *[Image: Barcode for "Shipping Area"]*

3.  Scan the rack that the units should be placed on.
    *   `<Rack 1>`

**Exercises: Loading an empty and a partly loaded truck**

Truck 1 (empty) and truck 2 (partly loaded) shall be loaded. The loading sequence is free, i. e. the trucks, racks and units can be loaded at random.

**Loading an empty and a partly loaded truck**
1.  Register truck 1 (RP) at the scanner: `<Begin> <Truck1>`
2.  Book units directly to truck 1: `<Unit 1> <Unit 2> <Unit 3>`
3.  Book racks to truck 1: `<Rack 1> <Rack 2>`
4.  Register truck 1 again. Thus, the previous rack will be logged out and the following units can be booked directly on the truck. If this step does not take place, the following units will be booked to the previous rack (rack 2 on truck 1).
    `<Truck1>`
5.  Book units directly to truck 1: `<Unit 4> <Unit 5>`
6.  Book racks to truck 1: `<Rack 3> <Rack 4> <Rack 5> <Rack 6>`
7.  Register truck 2 (RP) at the scanner. This de-registers truck 1 automatically: `<Truck2>`
8.  Book racks to truck 2: `<Rack 9> <Rack 10> <Rack 11>`
9.  Register truck 2 again. Thus, the previous rack will be logged out and the following units can be booked directly on the truck. If this step does not take place, the following units will be booked to the previous rack (rack 11 on truck 2).
    `<Rack 2>`
10. Book units directly to truck 2: `<Unit 6> <Unit 7> <Unit 8> <Unit 9>`
11. Book racks to truck 2: `<Rack 12><Rack 13>`
12. Register truck 1 (RP) at the scanner. This de-registers truck 2 automatically.
    `<Truck1>`
13. Book racks to truck 1: `<Rack 14> <Rack 15>`
14. Register truck 1 again. Thus, the previous rack will be logged out and the following units can be booked directly on the truck.
    `<Truck1>`
15. Book units directly to truck 1: `<Unit 10> <Unit 11>`
16. Loading of truck 1 is completed. The trigger time for truck 1 starts.
    `<Shipped > <Truck 1>`
17. Register truck 2 at the scanner. This de-registers truck 1 automatically.
    `<Truck2>`
18. Book racks to truck 2: `<Rack 9> <Rack 10> <Rack 11>`
19. Loading of truck 2 is completed. The trigger time for truck 2 starts.
    `<Shipped> <Truck 2>`

> **Note**
> Please stick to the scanning sequence if you want or have to load units and racks/boxes at random!
> When loading a truck, racks, boxes, and units can be allocated to the truck registration point. Please make sure that the units which are directly loaded onto the truck (registration point) are not booked to a previously loaded rack/box. Always finish loading a truck with the status booking `<Shipped> <Truck>`.

#### Scanning Racks and/or Boxes

**Prerequisite:** The employee's name and the current registration point must be scanned.

**How to scan a unit to an empty rack (rack will be emptied by barcoding)**
1.  Scan an empty rack: `<Begin> <Rack>`
    *[Image: Barcode for "begin" and a transport rack]*
2.  Scan the label of the unit.
    `<Unit 1>`
    `<Unit 2>`
    ...

**How to scan a transport rack ready for shipment**
`<Ready> <Rack 1> <Ready> <Rack 2> <Ready> <Rack ...>`

**How to scan the delivery Racks/Transport Racks**
`<Shipped> <Rack 1> <Shipped> <Rack 2> <Shipped> <Rack ...>`

**How to scan racks to the truck**
`<RegPoint> <Rack 1> <Rack 2> <Rack ...>`

**Additional information**
*   â¨ See Software Reference, "Racks"

#### Scanning the Status

Scanning a status barcode results in various barcoding activities in the background that are important for the entire production controlling. If a truck is assigned the `<Shipped>` status for example, this status will be applied to the entire load (racks, boxes, units, etc.); the load will be booked to the (system-) internal registration point 11 (Shipped).

The status barcode describes the status of an object, e.g. a unit (broken etc.), a rack (empty, complete, shipped/<Begin>, <Shipped>, <Broken>, <Ready>, etc.).

The status must **always** be scanned before the object (rack, unit, etc.). If several objects are to be assigned the same status, the status must be scanned separately for every object (`<Status> <Object> <Status> <Object>`).

**How to scan the status Reject Report Units**
`<Breakage> <Unit 1> <Breakage> <Unit 2> <Breakage> <Unit ...>`

**How to scan the status Delivery Units**
`<Shipped> <Unit 1> <Shipped> <Unit 2> <Shipped> <Unit ...>`

**How to scan the status Delivery Several Racks**
`<Shipped> <Rack 1> <Shipped> <Rack 2> <Shipped> <Rack ...>`

**How to scan the status Delivery Truck/Trailer (complete the loading) and Start the Trigger Time**
`<Shipped> <RegPoint>`

**How to register an empty rack (racks will be emptied by barcoding)**
`<Begin> <Rack>`

**How to register an empty registration point (registration point will be emptied by barcoding): Special case Truck**
`<Begin> <RegPoint>`

> **If the <Status> is scanned several times**
> If the status is scanned several times in a row `<Status1><Status2><Status3><Object>`, the last scanned status will be applied to the object, in this example `<Status3><Object>`. The barcode engine checks the bookings and will reject those that are not plausible, e.g. two status bookings in succession.

> **Caution for setting status to <Begin>:**
> The status `<Begin>` resets the object (rack, truck, etc) with respect to the registration point, i.e. to empty! If there were still units present according to barcoding, (e.g. on the truck or rack), they will be automatically assigned to the *Error Rack* registration point.
> Always finish loading a truck with the status booking `<Shipped> <Truck>`.

**Additional information**
*   â¨ See Software Reference, "Status Types"

#### Correcting Erroneous Entries

It is possible to correct erroneous entries with a new, correct booking! The additional booking is saved in the booking history but has no further effects apart from this correction.

**Example:**
If units have been booked to a rack instead of the registration point by mistake, this error can be corrected by first scanning the registration point and then the unit (to be repeated for every incorrectly scanned unit).
`<RegPoint> <Unit 1> <Unit 2> <Unit ...>`

### Production Terminals

This subject will provide you with a brief overview concerning the different production terminals. This includes the "Introduction" module.

#### Introduction

**Objectives**
*   Getting familiar with different terminals
*   Getting to know and understanding their functionality

**Benefits**
The Production Terminals support you when it comes to loading the lites of a unit from the rack to production (e.g. the line) in the correct sequence. To work efficiently, you have to understand the functioning of the terminals; you must also be capable of handling daily recurring situations.

**Definitions**

| Terminal | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Production Terminal IG** | Is used at the IG line. |
| **Production Terminal TG** | Is used at the TG line. |
| **Production Terminal LG** | Is used at the LG line. |
| **Production Terminal Order** | Is used wherever large quantities are booked. |
| **Production Terminal Manual Cutting** | Visualizes the work schedule for the lites to be cut at the manual cutting table. |
| **Production Terminal Processing** | Is used at the processing machines. |
| **Production Terminal Edit** | Is used in the shipping office. |

**Note**
Prerequisite for the use of the production terminals is an installed barcode manager (A+W Production).

Production Terminals are control stations for different work stations. Among other things, they are used to show and schedule the processing of lites according to various criteria, to book work performed, to report reject, to create subsequent parts automatically, or to create production statistics. Production terminals are typically used for:
*   Cutting
*   IG line
*   TG furnace
*   LAMI line
*   Dispatch

Control stations visualize and control individual processing steps and can be configured individually. A+W control stations can be used to print labels and reports online, and enter reject including all necessary information. Operation of the control stations is easy and uniform. These intelligent systems enable you to inform your customers of the current state of products at any time.

*[Image: Diagram showing an overview of a production landscape with various terminals, including Terminal Manual Cutting, Terminal Processing, Terminal TG-In/Out, Terminal LG-In/Out, and Terminals for IG Assembly.]*

As every workstation in production requires different information, there are standard terminals configured for the various processes and work flows.

#### A brief explanation of the individual production terminals:

*   **Terminal Manual Cutting**: Visualizes the work schedule for the lites to be cut at the manual cutting table.
*   **Terminal Order**: Is used wherever large quantities are booked.
*   **Terminal Processing**: Is the control station version used with the processing machines, automatically controlling the machines. This module provides detailed information on the processing steps to be performed including true-to-scale production drawings.
*   **Terminal IG-In**: Is installed at the IG line entrance and visualizes the work schedule for the lites to be produced for a batch or a logical production rack/harp rack, in production sequence.
*   **Terminal IG-Assembly**: Is installed between the visual check of lites after the washing machine, and in front of the spacer applicator, visualizing the technical data including the spacer data for each unit to be produced.
*   **Terminal IG-Out**: Installed at the IG line exit and shows the technical and shipping-related data for each unit produced.
*   **Terminal TG-In**: Is the display system at the furnace entry. It shows the furnace bed load and is controlled by the operator. All lites are registered at the scanner; their geometry is checked for completeness of processing.

### Reject Management

This subject shows you how to handle broken lites.

#### Overview

**Objectives**
*   Getting familiar with how to handle rejects.

**Benefits**
Manual input is not required and as a result the rejects are remade faster. Additional communication between the employees is also not required and thus are avoided.

**Definitions**
*   **Rejects Pool**: You will find an overview of the rejects in the Rejects Pool.

**Note**
*   **Rejects report**: The rejects report is executed at each *Production Terminal* or via scanner.
*   **Labels**: Labels are printed automatically at a central printer.
*   **Automatic remake**: The automatic remake is executed on the residue plate or by table optimization in the *A+W Realtime Optimizer*.

#### Reject Handling (Internal)

When units are reported broken, various internal actions are triggered. After a reject report, all information on the original unit plus all subsequent parts and remakes of subsequent parts will be saved in the database.

Subsequent parts will always be provided with the original barcode number. The barcode number of the original lite is provided with an index in the case of a reject report.

The table shows the changes resulting from the reject reports with regard to the individual flags and barcode numbers.

**Barcoding Reject Handling**

| Barcode | Registration point | Rack | Reject | Subsequent parts index | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 012345678 | Drilling | 15 | 0 | 0 | E1 |
| 012345678 001 | Drilling | 15 | 1 | 0 | E2 (Reject 1) |
| 012345678 | - | - | 0 | 1 | E3 |
| 012345678 002 | Furnace | 20 | 1 | 1 | E4 (Reject 2) |
| 012345678 | - | - | 0 | 2 | E5 |

**Description of table**
*   **E1**: The lite with barcode 012345678 is at the Drilling registration point, on rack 15. The lite has not been reported broken; the reject flag is zero. This is the original lite as the subsequent parts index is zero.
*   **E2**: The lite with barcode 012345678 is reported broken at the Drilling registration point. The reject flag is set. A three-digit index is added to the barcode number. Index 001 shows that this is the first reject.
*   **E3**: A subsequent part is created and is provided the original barcode number 012345678. In addition, the subsequent part index is increased by one (1). The subsequent part index distinguishes the subsequent part from the original lite. As the unit has not been entered, it is not allocated to a registration point.
*   **E4**: The subsequent part has made its way in the production area up to the furnace where it is reported broken. The reject flag is set. A three-digit index is added to the barcode number. Index 002 shows that this is the second reject.
*   **E5**: The second subsequent part is created and is provided with the original barcode number 012345678. In addition, the subsequent part index is increased by one (2). The subsequent part index distinguishes the subsequent part from the original lite. As the unit has not been entered, it is not allocated to a registration point.

> **Note**
> When you print labels for the subsequent parts or at reporting, the above-mentioned values and flags can be analyzed and taken into account. This is usually defined during the project planning phase and can be adapted to the current needs if required. Please ask A+W Software GmbH for available options.

> **Tip**
> You can use filters for the A+W Production views. Standard filters have been set for the barcode manager views which may not show units with a subsequent part index. To display these units, disable all filters (unfiltered). The name of the standard filter is Active!

> **Views and filters**
> For more information on the views and filters, please refer to the A+W Production manual.

### Statistics, Reporting and Monitoring

This subject will introduce you to the reports and different analyses.
This includes the following training modules:
*   "Barcode Reporting"
*   "Monitoring: A+W Dashboard"
*   "Statistics: A+W Discovery"

#### Overview

**Objectives**
*   Getting familiar with standard barcode reports.

**Benefits**
Using the standard reports, you will have an overview of the current status of your production at any time. This will save you time and effort and you are always able to provide your customers with accurate answers.

**Definition**
*   **Reports**: Are flexible tools to control and analyze the production.

**Note**
*   **Standard reports**: Are part of A+W Production
*   **Individual reports**: Can be created at customers' requests at any time.

#### Barcode Reporting

The described reports are standard barcode reports. It is possible to customize reports and create new reports. The reports are a flexible and powerful production control and analysis tool. Please contact A+W Software GmbH; we are glad to advise you and to perform the necessary changes, extensions and amendments or create new, customized reports.

> **Note**
> General reports analyzing a registration point usually show all units allocated to this registration point! If a partly loaded rack is registered at the IG line exit (registration point 1612) for instance to load IG units, the units already existing on this rack will also be booked to registration point 1612! To run analyses which show only the throughput of the IG line, for example, you will require amended reports.

##### Loading the Reports

Reports can be loaded via the A+W Production menu structure. The individual Production Terminals provide reports depending on their function. Shortcuts to reports can be saved on the PC desktop.

> **Note**
> The A+W Production menu structure is dynamic. Menu entries for the Barcode Manager are visible only if a Barcode Managerview is open.

##### Examples of Standard Barcode Reports

#### Monitoring: A+W Dashboard

**Objectives**
*   Brief introduction to A+W Dashboard
*   Getting to know the options

**Benefits**
A+W Dashboard shows the important key figures of the crucial production points to ensure a high level of transparency.

**Definitions**
*   **Traffic light**: The traffic light shows the current status of a registration point. You can define the meaning of the colors yourself.

**Note**
*   **Period of time**: Database tables with the A+W Production bookings are used for analyses. Usually a time period of max. 24 hours is taken into account.
*   **Correct display**: You need complete A+W Production bookings for meaningful displays.
*   **Display**: A+W Dashboard can be used both on large monitors in various production departments and mobile terminals such as smartphones.
*   **Malfunctions**: In the event of malfunctions, you can communicate the exact situation and in many cases even suggest your own solutions.

##### Overview

A+W Dashboard shows the important key figures of the crucial production points to ensure a high level of transparency. You get information on specific production areas in real time such as cutting to size, ISO lines, processing and TG production: e.g. you will see the actual degree of utilization, the status of each machine, and the production progress.

This program can be used both on large monitors in various production departments and mobile terminals such as smartphones, tablet computers or PDAs. However, this requires an internet browser and access to this program (address and user account).

A+W Production contains predefined displays, although it can also be adapted to individual machines or departments. This enables you to keep an eye on the critical points of your production and take action wherever necessary.

Database tables with the barcoding bookings are used for analysis. Usually a time period of max. 24 hours is taken into account. This is how A+W Dashboard differs from A+W Discovery which allows statistical analyses over longer periods of time.

The analyses are visualized in different ways. You can zoom in and out of the displays and change pages by swiping.

*[Image: Examples of visualization types in A+W Dashboard: A) Traffic light, B) Pie chart, C) Plot diagram, D) Bar chart, E) Speedometer.]*

You can set up each of these display types to correspond with the demands of your production departments and monitoring.

*   **Traffic light (A)**: The traffic light shows the current status of a registration point. You can define the meaning of the colors yourself. This display makes sense for status displays over very short periods such as showing whether a machine is operating or has broken down.
*   **Pie chart (B)**: The pie chart shows the shares of machine statuses reported over a self-defined period. By default, this represents the past 24 hours. With it, the total of all downtimes of all shifts during the time period can be viewed.
*   **Plot diagram (C)**: This line shows the bookings of a past period of time spread out over a display period such as the bookings of the last hour spread over the display period. One point shows the total per grouping (such as per minute, hour or day).
*   **Bar chart (D)**: The bar chart shows statistical data collected via SQL queries. These statistics have to be available for view configuration.
*   **Speedometer (E)**: The speedometer shows the present capacity utilization. For this purpose, the number of booked pieces during the past hour is analyzed. The red-yellow-green marking indicates how the number of pieces are assessed.

> **Correct display only if barcoding bookings are correct**
> You need complete barcoding bookings for meaningful displays.
> A+W Dashboard links the production software A+W Production and the A+W Production Terminal. The Barcoding data is read out through the PPS Web Service.

> **A+W Dashboard**
> Please see the A+W Dashboard manual for detailed information on this module.

#### Statistics: A+W Discovery

**Objectives**
*   Brief introduction to A+W Discovery
*   Getting to know the options

**Benefits**
A+W Discovery is used to collect, edit, and visualize your business data. Management and controlling staff can analyze this information and use it for their business decisions.

**Definitions**
*   **Pivot table**: Is a special type of table with the option to display data in different ways.
*   **Fiscal year**: Business year for which a company compiles the results of its business in an annual financial statement.

**Note**
*   **A+W Discovery**: Allows you to create long-term analyses of production data.
*   **Analyses**: Analyses can easily be created in the form of pivot tables using Microsoft Excel.
*   **Data provision**: A+W Discovery can provide data from the ERP systems (A+W Enterprise, A+W Business) and the PPS system (A+W Production).
*   **Client-wide analyses**: You can create client-wide analyses.

##### Overview

Constantly growing demands on modern ERP and PPS systems require more and more powerful controlling and control mechanisms. This is due to tax and legal conditions, and the necessity of analyzing the product portfolio, productivity, and capacity utilization from different points of view.

A+W Discovery is the state-of-the-art Business Intelligence System of A+W Software GmbH tailored to the special needs of modern glass producers and processors. Its setup and integration with the PPS system A+W Production allows evaluating and offsetting statistical parameters and indices from different points of view and deducing the necessary strategic, commercial, or production-related decisions and steps.

You can, for instance, collect data revealing the gross margin and the sales volume of certain locations or subsidiaries for a defined time frame (e.g. month or year). This enables you to adjust your cost structures accordingly if necessary, and motivate your staff and sales partners to achieve an increase in turnover in the following year. Version 5.4 additionally implements the fiscal year and fiscal quarter.

You will also be able to analyze key production figures like the quantity of reject per work station or machine downtimes within a defined time frame.

*[Image: Screenshots of A+W Discovery in Excel, showing pivot tables and charts for rejects, produced quantities, and machine activity.]*

Apart from that, A+W Discovery comes with predefined A+W standard reports which allow comparing and aggregating meaningful PPS data. This will put you in full control of all commercial and production-relevant data, products, resources, costs, times, and capacities.
