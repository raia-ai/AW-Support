## Functional Principle

### Formula Editor

The formula editor is available in A+W Production in the sections:
- Organization
- Machinery Allocation
- Labels, Sketches, Bender Text

The formula editor has different levels. The more complex the formula, the higher the level.

The documentation on the formula editor was therefore split into:
- Elements of the Formula Editor: Level I
- Elements of the Formula Editor: Level II
- Elements of the Formula Editor: Level III

#### Objective of the Formula Editor

With regards to Organization, the formula editor is used to define conditions to allocate product properties to the appropriate racks.

In connection with machinery allocation, the formula editor is used to localize machinery depending on the processing, and the product properties.

Regarding labels, the formula editor helps to define conditions to select the necessary label layout with regards to the product properties.

#### Elements of the Formula Editor: Level I

The formula editor consists of the elements:
- "Formula" on page R-10
- "Comparison" on page R-11
- "Condition" on page R-11
- "Quantity" on page R-14
- "Allocation" on page R-15

##### Formula

In the simplest case, a formula consists of a term which can contain the valid object properties, constants, other formulas, and some operators. Possible operators are the basic arithmetical operations +, -, * and / plus brackets. Also, there are the String operators:

- `@LEFT`: Syntax STRING `@LEFT` ANZAHL = STRING
- `@RIGHT`: Syntax STRING `@RIGHT` ANZAHL = STRING
- `@MID`: Syntax STRING `@MID` INDEX = STRING ; the index is 0-based

All these operators can be mixed at random.
The formula affects just one element.

*Fig. R-1: Formula Editor screen showing an input field for a formula, with lists for existing properties and formulas.*

**Examples:**
- `$TEILETYP`
- `$MENGE * ($DICKE+1000)`
- `($BEARB1TEXT @MID $TEILETYP) @RIGHT ($DICKE/1000)`

##### Comparison

A comparison consists of 1-2 formulas, and a so-called comparison rule. Please note that you can use just one formula only if the comparison rule `Only formula 1` is used. In this case, the comparison is fulfilled if the result of formula 1 is one digit bigger than zero, or a non-empty string. Otherwise, the comparison is fulfilled if the term `FORMEL 1 VORSCHRIFT FORMEL 2` is true.

For formula 2, no formula needs to be defined for simple constants. In this case, activate radio button `Value` and enter the required constant.

*Fig. R-2: Comparison dialog showing two formula fields and a dropdown for comparison operators.*

**Examples:**
- Formula Element type = value 1
- Formula IG `Only formula 1`
- Formula triple width < Formula height
- Formula thickness = value 3 mm

##### Condition

*Fig. R-3: Condition with And Connection, showing multiple comparison fields linked together.*

A condition must be fulfilled so that the allocation can be made as defined by the formula(s). It is the top element within the formula structure and, in its simplest type, consists of a number of comparisons. The grouping of comparisons defines how the results of the comparisons must be linked to each other. Comparisons set next to another are linked by AND while comparisons set above one another are linked by OR. A condition is fulfilled if it is possible to find a horizontal path from left to right which only includes fulfilled comparisons.

**Examples: Simplest Type**

*Fig. R-4: Schematic Display of a Condition, showing a "Condition" box labeled "Ist ESG" linked to a "Comparison" box.*
*Fig. R-5: Conditions - Author dialog showing the components of an elementary condition.*

The condition is `toughened glass` is fulfilled if the formula `element type toughened glass` with the property of database field `E_TG` from `Pool_Elements` contains the value One (based on the operation `only formula`).

**Examples: Linking of Elementary Conditions**

*Fig. R-6: Schematic Display of the Linking of Elementary Conditions, illustrating AND and OR linking logic.*
*Fig. R-7: UI example of linking elementary conditions for Shape Number and Processing.*

##### Quantity

*Fig. R-8: Quantities - Creator dialog showing different quantity selection options (Master, Parent, Self, etc.).*

A quantity consists of the rule of how to form the final quantity from the start element (BOM). The following rules can be combined at random.
⇨ Software Reference, "Quantity Editor" on page R-59

An element can represent a processing step.

*Fig. R-9: Schematic Display of the quantity, showing a BOM tree structure for an IG unit.*

For instance, the condition is `toughened glass` and quantity `Parent` results in all final and interim products produced from one or more toughened glass elements.

##### Allocation

The simplest type is the allocation of an object property to a formula. The result of the formula is allocated to the object property.

**Example:**
- EXTRA THICKNESS = formula `2mm`
- STACK WIDTH = `Height`

#### Elements of the Formula Editor: Level II

The formula editor consists of the elements:
- "Formula" on page R-15
- "Comparison" on page R-16
- "Condition" on page R-16
- "Quantity" on page R-17
- "Allocation" on page R-18

##### Formula

The formula now contains a quantity plus instructions. Without the quantity, the formula directly affects the object to be checked. When a quantity is defined, the object to be checked is converted into a quantity, the object being the start object of the quantity. The formula will be applied to each object of the final quantity; the results will be linked according to instructions. If the final quantity contains no objects, a long value -1 is returned.

*Fig. R-10: Formula dialog showing operation options like Total, Average, AND, OR, etc.*

**Examples:**
- `$THICKNESS`; quantity: `all basic elements`; TOTAL➔ total thickness
- `1`; quantity: `all processings`; TOTAL → number of processings

Valid operations are `total`, `average`, `And link`, `Or link`, `minimum` and `maximum`.

##### Comparison

Normally, a comparison consists of 1-2 formulas and the instruction. Alternatively, a comparison can be expressed by a condition (activate radio button `Conditions`). In this case, the comparison is fulfilled if the allocated condition is fulfilled. This type of linking conditions is used whenever two or more conditions are applied to different quantities.

*Fig. R-11: Comparison dialog showing a condition being used instead of a second formula.*

##### Condition

A condition can be inverted, i.e. it is fulfilled if the result of the comparisons is not fulfilled, and vice versa. This way, you can easily create from an existing condition the inverted one. The inverted condition contains just one comparison which will be allocated the original condition. Moreover, the characteristic `invert` will be selected for the inverted condition. The status line shows `INV` in front of the condition name.

The comparisons are usually analyzed for the object to be checked. If you want to check however whether one of the sub-elements of an object has a certain element type/processing type, you can allocate a quantity to the condition. In this case, the object is changed into a quantity, the object being the start object of the quantity. The condition will be analyzed for all elements of the final quantity. You only need to define when the condition is fulfilled. If it is sufficient that part of the final quantity fulfils the condition, select operation `One`. If the condition is only fulfilled if all elements of the final quantity fulfil the condition, select operation `All`. If the final quantity contains no objects, the condition is not fulfilled.

**Examples:**
- Formula `Element type` = value `125`; quantity `All sub-elements`; `One` with processing type =125
- Formula `E_IG` `Only formula 1`, quantity `Main element`; `One` (or `All`). The main element is IG.

*Fig. R-12: Condition Editor showing a condition with an associated quantity.*

##### Quantity

The quantity definition contains a condition. All objects which does not fulfil the condition, will be removed from the final quantity.

**Example:**
- `; Anychild; condition processing;`
  -> The final quantity contains only the processings below the start element.

If a condition is used, the two instructions `Up` and `Addup` can be used. These must not be combined with other instructions.

Using `Up` means that the final quantity consists of one element only. Starting from the start element, all main elements of the start element will be checked whether they fulfil the condition. The final quantity contains the last element fulfilling the condition. Should one element fail to fulfil the condition, the upwards iteration will be aborted.

`Addup` means that the final quantity can consist of more than one element. Like with `Up`, there is an upward iteration from the start element which will be stopped should one element fail to fulfil the condition. The final quantity, however, contains all elements fulfilling the condition.

**Examples:**
- `; Up; condition no processing`
- `; Addup; condition not ordered`

##### Allocation

The allocation can include a quantity. In this case, the result of the formula of the property will be allocated to all objects of the final quantity.

**Example:**
- EXTRA THICKNESS = Formula `2mm`; quantity `All cut elements`

#### Elements of the Formula Editor: Level III

##### Quantity

Quantity definition will always be loaded with a start quantity. In simple cases, the start quantity consists of just one element, namely the start element. Dialog `Quantity Editor` allows to logically group several elements next to each other or below each other, like in the `Conditions Editor`. The elements in the `Quantity Editor` are different. The vertically grouped quantities form the combined quantity while the horizontally grouped quantities form the intersection.

Please note that there is a second window for the edition of quantities. You can switch between the first and second window via button `[+/-]`. The start quantity is found by removing from the quantity of the first(+) window all objects of the quantity of the second(-) window.

**Examples:**
- `{quantity main element or Self; Anychild + Self ; ; }`
  - 1st window (Plus): Quantity `main element` or `self`
  - 2nd window (Minus): empty
  - `Anychild` and `Self` are tagged

This produces a main element, and all sub-elements of the main element. If there is no main element, the final quantity includes the start element and all its sub-elements.

*Fig. R-13: Quantities - Creator dialog showing the setup for a quantity calculation.*

The result is the final quantity with all elements sharing the main element of the start element.

If the iteration for `Up` or `Addup` shall not start with the element itself, but with the main element, first form the start quantity from the start element, using quantity main element `{;Parent;;}`, and use this with the required quantity, and the instruction `Up` or `Addup`.

This quantity can be allocated a formula. In this case, the formula will be analyzed for all elements of the start quantity; the results will be saved. From the final quantity, all elements will be removed the start quantity of which does not contain the result of the formula.

**Example:**
- `; All;; Formula Element type`
  Produces all elements of the BOM which are of the same type as the start element.

#### Function

**ASSIGNMENT**
The UserSet is transferred to FORMULA and SET.
- **without Set, without UserSet**: The FORMULA will be analyzed for this object. The result of the FORMULA is allocated to the object PROPERTY.
- **With Set**: SET is used to create a quantity from the given object. For every element of this quantity, the FORMULA will be analyzed; the result will be allocated to the PROPERTY of the corresponding object.
- **With UserSet**: For every object of the UserSet, the FORMULA will be analyzed; the result will be allocated to the PROPERTY of the corresponding object.
- **With Set, with UserSet**: Invalid, impossible.

**FORMULA**
The UserSet is transferred to the SET and to all FORMULAs in formula elements.
- **without Set, without UserSet**: All formulaelements for the given object will be analyzed; the complete term will be calculated. The result is returned as MultiValue.
- **With Set**: SET is used to create a quantity from the given object. All formulaelements for every element of this quantity will be analyzed; the complete term will be calculated. The results will be analyzed as per Operation; the total result will be returned as MultiValue.
- **With UserSet**: All formulaelements for every element of the UserSet will be analyzed; the complete term will be calculated. The results will be analyzed as per Operation; the total result will be returned as MultiValue.
- **With Set, with UserSet**: invalid, impossible

**CONDITIONS**
The UserSet is transferred to SET and to all CONDITION(S)s in the conditionelements.
- **without Set, without UserSet**: All conditionelements for the given object will be analyzed; the total result will be calculated and returned as BOOLEAN.
- **With Set, (with Operation != ZERO)**: SET is used to create a quantity from the given object. All formulaelements for every element of this quantity will be analyzed; the complete BOOLEAN term will be calculated. If the Operation = ONE, CONDITIONS will return TRUE if for at least one element the complete BOOLEAN term is fulfilled, i.e. TRUE. If however the Operation = ALL, CONDITIONS will return TRUE if the complete BOOLEAN term is fulfilled, i.e. TRUE for all elements. Otherwise, FALSE will be returned.
- **With UserSet**: All formulaelements for every element of the UserSet will be analyzed; the complete BOOLEAN term will be calculated. If the Operation = ONE, CONDITIONS will return TRUE if for at least one element the complete BOOLEAN term is fulfilled, i.e. TRUE. If however the Operation = ALL, CONDITIONS will return TRUE if the complete BOOLEAN term is fulfilled, i.e. TRUE for all elements. Otherwise, FALSE will be returned.
- **With Set, with UserSet**: invalid, impossible

**CONDITION**
The UserSet is transferred to every FORMULA.
- **Any**: Both FORMULAS, if existing, will be analysed for the given object. If there is only one FORMULA, TRUE will be returned if the result of FORMULA is not ZERO (numeric result), or if it is no empty string for string results. Otherwise, FALSE will be returned. If both FORMULAs do exist, the results will be compared acc. to the Operation. If the comparison is fulfilled, TRUE will be returned; otherwise, FALSE.

**SET**
All SETS, CONDITIONS and FORMULA included in setelements will be transferred to the UserSet.
- **without FORMULA, without UserSet**: All setelements for the given Set will be calculated; the preliminary quantity A will be determined. For every object of this quantity A, quantity BA will be determined as per Operation, to be added to quantity B. From quantity B, all objects will be removed which do not fulfil the CONDITIONS. As a result, quantity B is returned as RelatedSet.
- **with FORMULA, without UserSet**: Initially like A, but quantity B will not be returned. The FORMULA will be analyzed for every object from the given Set. The results will be saved in an array. Next, the FORMULA is analyzed for every object in quantity B. If the array includes the result of the FORMULA for an object from quantity B, the corresponding object will be added to quantity C. As a result, quantity C is returned as RelatedSet.
- **without FORMULA, with UserSet**: Like A, but instead of the given Sets, the UserSet will be used to form quantity A.
- **with FORMULA, with UserSet**: Like B, but instead of the given Sets, the UserSet will be used to form quantity A. Still, the given Set will be used to form the array.

**Example:**
For lite A and a certain number of lites, you want to determine the total number of all lites belonging to the same route as lite A:
`[$MENGE ; { ; ; ; [$TOUR] /USERSET } ; SUM }`

Lite X shall be kept at the rack only if it is laminated glass, and if the total of all lites includes at least 150 laminated lites:
`´ ('[T_VSG;;]=[1;;];;` AND ´[$MENGE;{;;''[T_VSG;;]==[1;;]';;';/USERSET};SUM]`>=[150;;]`) ; ; ``

#### Check Results

To check the results of the formulas, you can view the corresponding log file. To activate the result check for Detailed Scheduling, the following setting must be made in A+W Production:

Master Data > Parameters > Module Detailed Scheduling > Specials > View Formula > Enter value 1

> **Performance**

### Group Formation Mode

This example serves to add another selectable mode for group formation for organization groups and racks.

**This is how you create a grouping by number of lites per customer, i.e. a group will be created per customer and this group will be sorted by the number of lites included. The group with the largest number of lites will be produced first.**

1.  Open the `Grouping/Sorting` Dialog via:
    Master Data > Detailed Scheduling > Grouping
2.  Press button `[Formulas ...]`. The dialog `Select Formulas --1--` appears.
3.  Press button `[New Formula ...]`. The dialog `Formula Editor` appears.
4.  Enter the name for the grouping formula in the top left field. In our example, `number of lites per customer`.
5.  In section `Existing Properties`, double-click on `Qty`. Section `Formula` shows `$Qty`.
6.  Press button `[Quantity ...]`. The dialog `Select Quantity --1--` appears.
7.  Use button `[New Quantity ...]` to define a new quantity. This opens dialog `Quantity Editor`. Starting from a given quantity we will perform quantity operations to get the final quantity. Detailed Scheduling transfers to the formula editor values for a customer's item, the quantity calculation, and all orders of the job on hand. Just add the customer number.
8.  In menu `Quantity`, open `Names` and enter a new, characteristic name for the quantity. In our example, `number of lites per customer`. Close the dialog via button `[OK]`.
9.  In menu `Quantity`, open `Given Quantity`. As a result, not only the item used to start the quantity editor will be considered for quantity calculation, but also all items of the job.
10. As the required quantity shall not include all elements, but only the released elements, activate in dialog `Quantity Editor` the checkbox `Master`.
11. To add the customer number as a property to the quantity, select in menu `Quantity`, `Formula`. The dialog `Select Formulas --2--` appears. Use button `[New Formula ...]` to enter the formula for the customer number. The dialog `Formula Editor` appears.
12. Enter the formula name in the top left input field. In our example, `Customer Number`.
13. In section `Existing Properties`, double-click on `Customer No.` Section `Formula` shows `$Customer No.`
14. Press `[Ok]`. You will return to dialog `Select Formulas --2--`. The last entry on the list will be the just defined formula for the customer number. Tag the `Customer No.` on the list, and press `[Ok]`. This brings you back to dialog `Quantity Editor`.
15. The right side of the status line of the quantity editor shows whether - and if so, which - formula is used to define the new quantity. In our example, this is: `Formula: Customer No.`
16. Tag all open dialogs via `[Ok]` until you reach dialog `Grouping/Sorting`.
17. The list of formulas now includes the formula `number of lites per customer`. Tag the formula and press `[Add]`. The formula will be added to the groupings in tab `Grouping Editor`. It will be available in the settings for the `Organization Groups` and the `Racks`, in section `Group Formation`.

### Conditions for Production Sections

This tells you how to define, change, or delete conditions for production sections in part `Machinery Allocation`.

**How to define a condition for a production section, filtering all lites with Grills**

1.  Open dialog `Production Sections` via:
    Master Data > Machinery Allocation > Setup
2.  Tag the production section for which you want to define a condition.
3.  Use the right mouse key. The context menu appears. From the context menu, select:
    `Condition of production section > New`
4.  The dialog `Select Conditions --1--` appears.
5.  Press button `[New Condition ...]`. This opens the dialog `Conditions Editor`.
6.  In menu `Conditions`, open `Names`. This leads to dialog `Condition Name`. Field `New Name` shows `New Condition` by default. Give the condition a characteristic name. In our example: `Grills - IG`. Close the dialog via button `[OK]`.
7.  In menu `Conditions`, open `Info`. This opens dialog `Info`. Enter a clear description of this condition. Example: `This condition is true if the item shows a Grill flag`. Close the dialog via button `[OK]`.
8.  In menu `Partial Conditions`, open `Add Part.Cond. (AND)`. A new element condition appears, and can be configured.
9.  The combo box shows `Only Formula 1` by default. In our example, this remains unchanged.
10. The radio button `Normal` is active by default. In our example, this remains unchanged, too.
11. Click on the top input field of the condition. The dialog `Select Formulas --1--` appears automatically.
12. Press button `[New Formula ...]`. The dialog `Formula Editor` appears. Enter a characteristic name for the formula in the top left field. In our example: `Grills`.
13. In section `Existing Properties` double-click on `Item_Grill_Flag`. Section `Formula` shows `$Item_Grill_Flag`.
14. Close the dialog via button `[OK]`. This brings you to dialog `Select Formulas --1--`. The just defined formula is tagged already.
15. Close the dialog via button `[OK]`. You will find yourself back in dialog `Condition Editor`.

The defined condition looks like this:
*Fig. R-17: Condition IG with Grills, showing the formula 'Grills' with 'Only Formula 1'.*

Close the dialog via menu `Conditions > OK`, or by clicking on the checkmark.
You will find yourself back in dialog `Select Conditions --1--`. You will find the defined condition `Grills - IG` at the end of the list `Existing Properties`.

**This is how to allocate a condition to a production section**

1.  Open dialog `Production Section` via:
    Master Data > Machinery Allocation > Setup
2.  Tag the production section the condition shall be allocated to.
3.  Use the right mouse key. The context menu appears. From the context menu, select:
    `Condition for Production Section > New`
4.  The dialog `Select Conditions --1--` appears.
5.  On the list of `Existing Conditions`, tag the condition to be allocated to this production section.
6.  Close the dialog via button `[OK]`.
7.  The condition was added to the tagged production section.

**How to delete a condition allocated to a production section**

1.  Open dialog `Production Section` via:
    Master Data > Machinery Allocation > Setup
2.  Double-click on the production section to open it.
3.  Tag the condition to be deleted.
4.  Use the right mouse key. The context menu appears. From the context menu, select `Delete Condition`.

### More Examples

**How to define a condition for toughened glass within IG, or float glass processing**

1.  **First step**
    *Fig. R-18: Toughened Glass condition.*
    In formula `Toughened Glass`, the property `E_TG` is returned.
2.  **Now check whether the element is part of IG**
    *Fig showing a complex quantity operation to identify a 'Mate' part by starting with a parent, finding all children, and subtracting itself.*
3.  As an element cannot be toughened glass and IG at the same time, the condition shown in step 2 cannot work. Hence ...
4.  Check the Or connection, whether one of the sub-elements is a processing step. Another condition will be created, checking the formula `Processing` for all childs.
    *Fig. R-19 & R-20: OR connection logic to check if a part is TGH OR its parent is IG, and checking for processing steps.*

**The processing steps directly below**

1.  The final quantity shall contain only the processing steps below the start element which will be made after the last processing steps defined.
2.  The system first unites all sub-elements which are no processings.
3.  Quantity `Defined processing steps below` = `{ ; ANYCHILD ; condition is no processing; }`
4.  This quantity is used to define the number of elements and processing steps below the start element you do not require.
5.  Quantity `Unwanted elements/processing steps below` = `{ number of defined processing steps below ; ANYCHILD+SELF ; ; }`
6.  The required quantity is determined by the number of `all sub-elements` and the number of `unwanted elements/processing steps below`.
    `{ number of all sub-elements - number of unwanted elements/processings below; SELF ; ; }`
