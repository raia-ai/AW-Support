## Tutorial

### A+W Production

A+W - Software for Glass, Windows and Doors

---

## Basic Ideas

A major potential for saving in the flat glass processing is the optimum use of the stockplates at cutting. The smaller the waste or the residue plates, the higher is the use of material, and the lower the material cost. Controlling cutting tables with optimized cutting plans directly from the optimization speeds up the work process.

A+W Realtime Optimizer is based on two fundamental ideas:
- Cutting optimization for the linked cutting table
- Transfer of cutting codes to the linked cutting table

*Fig. J-1 - Cutting optimization and cutting table control (Screenshot of the software interface showing batch optimization parameters and status).*

### Features

A+W Realtime Optimizer supports these fundamental ideas with the following features:

- A+W Realtime Optimizer controls cutting by means of optimized detailed scheduling data.
- Rush orders, rejects or filler sizes can be automatically re-optimized in a residue plate.
- Cutting tables are controlled mainly online by means of communication logs supported by the table manufacturers.
- Rush order lites, rejects and fillers are optimized directly at the cutting table.
- Existing optimizations can be checked with regards to table optimization, to be resolved and reassembled if required. By adding rejects, filler sizes and rush orders, bigger optimizations can be created. Defined sequences on A racks are maintained.
- Even at the detailed scheduling stage, A+W Production allows optimizing the cutting of every batch on the scheduled cutting table.
- A+W Realtime Optimizer is especially configured for a cutting table, and can transfer the scheduled and optimized batches to this cutting table, together with the cutting code.
- Once the appropriate cutting code has been transferred to the cutting table, the breakout pattern can be displayed via XTV.

## Using A+W Realtime Optimizer

This subject area introduces the functions of A+W Realtime Optimizer. This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- **Import of Data**
  - Working with A+W Production
  - Use as a stand-alone system

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding import of data
- Getting to know and understanding the connection to A+W Production.
- Getting to know and understanding the operation as stand-alone system

**Benefit**
The data have to be imported correctly before working with A+W Realtime Optimizer.

**Definitions**

- **Pre-systems:** These systems supply with orders (batches) containing master data and cutting optimizations.
- **Stand alone variant:** The stand alone system imports the data by means of save files which must be provided in a special directory.
- **Residue stock:** The residue stock manages residue plates at the cutting table.

**Note**

- **A+W Realtime Optimizer:** Can be adapted to all common cutting tables.
- **Stand alone variant:** The A+W Realtime Optimizer can be used as stand alone.
- **Connection:** The staff of A+W configure the import of data.

### Import of Data

Depending on the basic system, data are imported fully or semi-automatically. These systems supply A+W Realtime Optimizer with batches containing base data and cutting optimizations.

*Fig. J-2 - Overview of the work with A+W Realtime Optimizer; the work shown in italics only apply in connection with stand alone systems (Diagram showing Batches -> A+W Realtime Optimizer (Input, Optimization, Cutting code creation) -> Database -> Cutting table control -> Cutting table)*

A multitude of possible configurations open up the following possibilities in connection with A+W Realtime Optimizer:
- Integrated in an A+W Production or an A+W Business Pro environment
- Adapting to all common cutting tables
- Link to a residue stock plate
- Use as a stand-alone system

The system is configured and installed by A+W staff.

Possible basic systems are:
- A+W Production
- A+W Business Pro

> **Linking to the basic system**
> The staff of A+W configure the basic system and the import of data.

*Fig. J-3 - Data import in A+W Realtime Optimizer (Diagram showing Import files and A+W Production feeding data into A+W Realtime Optimizer, which checks and imports it into the A+W Production Database containing batches and master data.)*

If A+W Realtime Optimizer works with A+W Production, A+W Realtime Optimizer uses the A+W Production database as well. If another system is used, A+W Realtime Optimizer needs an empty A+W Production database. Master data and optimizations included in the batches of the basic system will be adopted by A+W Realtime Optimizer into the empty A+W Production database. Data are checked at the same time.

The system rejects data which cause errors during import. The error log shows why the individual records were rejected. The data can be processed further.

### Working with A+W Production

When A+W Realtime Optimizer is linked to an existing A+W Production system, data are exchanged automatically. Master data, batches, rejects, rush and filler orders are directly loaded from the A+W Production database. Apart from that, status reports for the individual batches are saved in the database.

#### Master data
If the access to base data was released at configuration, these can be viewed and processed.
Master data include:
- Articles
- Glass Types
- Tables
- Optimization parameters
- Stockplates

Master data and their use are described in section Detailed Scheduling of the A+W Production user manual.

### Use as a stand-alone system

A+W Realtime Optimizer is installed with an empty A+W Production database. When batches are imported, the database is filled with master data.

The stand alone system imports the data by means of save files which must be provided to A+W Realtime Optimizer in a special directory. Save files have to stick to a defined structure and are usually available in the working directory `...\Xopton\import\work\*save.*`. Imported data are removed from the working directory, and transferred to archives.

#### Import optimizations
Function Import optimizations is only required and valid for A+W Realtime Optimizer stand alone versions.

A+W Realtime Optimizer can supply a cutting table with cutting data or create table optimizations if batches are provided by another system. If batches are supplied, A+W Realtime Optimizer can import them for further processing.

The following steps can be performed in connection with the import of batches:
- Switch on import
- Switch off import
- React to error reports

#### Switch on import
1. Open the dialog `Import`. Select `View > Import`.
2. Use the `[Start]` button to start the import.
   A+W Realtime Optimizer checks the working directory for import files. If import files are found, the data are imported into the database while the import files are transferred to archives.
   Imported batches are available for further processing in the dialogs `Select a batch` and `Select glass for optimization`.
   Button `[Start]` becomes `[Stop]`.
3. Close the dialog. Press the `[Close]` button.
   A+W Realtime Optimizer monitors the working directory until the import function is switched off.
   Should errors occur during import, these are recorded; and the batches in question will not be imported. Errors can be processed manually.

#### Switch off import
1. Open the dialog `Import`. As long as import is switched on, a minimized dialog is shown in the bottom left corner of the A+W Realtime Optimizer dialog.
2. Use the `[Stop]` button to terminate import.
   Import files just stored in the working directory remain there, unprocessed.
   Button `[Stop]` changes into `[Start]`.
3. Close the dialog. Press the `[Close]` button.

#### React to error reports
Should errors occur during import, these are recorded; and the batches in question will not be imported.
Import is stopped only at an imminent loss of data. This may be the case if an existing optimization shall be overridden. Depending on the configuration, an error message appears.

1. Answer the question in the error report dialog xopt-on. Select the appropriate button, `[Yes]` or `[No]`. Import of data is resumed.
2. Open dialog `Error messages`. Select menu `View > Error reports`.
3. Check the error messages and respond accordingly.

## Input

This section tells you how to handle the input. This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Rejects, Rush Order Lites or Filler Orders
- Manual Creation of Plans
- Charge Editor

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding rejects.
- Getting to know and understanding rush order lites.
- Getting to know and understanding filler orders.

**Benefit**
By using rejects, rush order lites and filler orders you can improve the yield.

**Definitions**
- **Reject:** A lite broken during cutting.
- **Rush order lite:** A lite that must be cut quickly.
- **Filler order:** Serves to use capacities and material efficiently.

**Note**
- **Rejects:** Rejects can be entered manually via A+W Realtime Optimizer, or at another place within a networked production.
- **Rush order lites:** Rush order lites are created by A+W Realtime Optimizer and are saved in the database.
- **Filler orders:** Filler orders can be used only if A+W Realtime Optimizer is used together with A+W Production.

### Rejects, Rush Order Lites or Filler Orders

Rejects can be entered manually via A+W Realtime Optimizer, or at another place within a networked production. Depending on the configuration, reject is directly shown in the A+W Realtime Optimizer rejects pool. At the next opportunity, the broken lites are automatically optimized with the residue plate, or (depending on the configuration) integrated manually into a table optimization.

Rush orders are created by A+W Realtime Optimizer and are saved in the database. Rush orders can be integrated in the next table optimization with a suitable glass type and thickness.

Filler orders can be used only if A+W Realtime Optimizer is used together with A+W Production. In this case, filler orders are directly taken from the A+W Production database.

*Fig. J-4 - Input and processing of data in A+W Realtime Optimizer (Diagram showing Rush orders, Breakage, and Filler as inputs to Realtime Optimizer, which interacts with the A+W Production Database.)*

### Manual entry of lites

1. Select menu `Input > Manual Plan`. Dialog `Manual Plan Input Cutting Table ...` appears.
2. In section `Glass Types` select the glass type you want to create the plan for.
3. On the left select the stock size in section `Stockplates`, that shall be used for the manual cutting pattern.
4. In section `Residue Plates` define height and width for the residue plate to be created.
5. Click on the icon `[New]`. A+W PlanEditor opens.
6. Enter the requested lites via context menu. Thus, select option `Insert` and enter the specific lite data.
7. Via `File > Save as` it is possible to save the cutting plan as file.
8. Use `Output > AWC` for transfer to cutting.

#### How to edit a manual plan
1. To edit a manually entered cutting plan, choose `Input > Manual Plan` from menu. Dialog `Manual Plan Input Cutting Table ...` opens. The lower section `Plan` shows the plan previously entered.
2. Use the `[Edit]` button to open the plan, previously entered and make the modifications.
3. Don't forget to save the modifications or to release the data via `Output > AWC`.

#### How to select a plan manually entered for cutting
1. A plan manually entered can only be cut directly via `Cutting`.
2. Use the `[Cutting]` button to select all batches optimized and prepared for cutting.
3. The manually created plan appears in the list of available batches with batch number >15000 and has the additional information `PlanEdit`.
4. Select the batch and prepare it for cutting (`[Options]` button) or cut it directly (`[Cutting]` button).

**Additional information**
- ⇨ Software Reference, "Manual Plan Input" on page J-64

### Charge Editor

Via this dialog it is possible to define a charge number. Tag the checkbox and the entered charge number will be inherited to the following stockplates of the identical glass type/thickness. The last charge number is saved per glass type/thickness/stock plate. Next time, this editor will be opened the input field is pre-set with this value. The allocation always affects the selected stock size (and in case of inheritance those below).

A set charge (including inheritance) can also be deleted via this editor.

If the cutting process for a stock size has no batch allocation, the user has to enter a charge number first. The dialog `Charge Editor` appears with a corresponding info in A+W Production Terminal (XTV). The entered charge number is used for all lites of the respective stock size while passing the A+W Production Terminal (XTV).

## Optimization

This section shows you how the optimization works. This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Cutting Table Optimizations
- Create a Quick Optimization
- Linking of Batches
- Cutting Table Control

### Overview

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding table optimizations
- Getting to know and understanding quick optimizations
- Getting to know and understanding linking of residue plates
- Getting to know and understanding cutting table control

**Benefit**
The more efficient the optimization works, the higher the yield. This saves money.

**Definitions**
- **Cutting table optimizations:** Optimizations, created with A+W Realtime Optimizer.
- **Quick optimization:** Plates, not sent yet to the cutting table can be resolved completely and re-optimized.

**Note**
- **Batch:** A batch is a composition of glass from one or more orders, to be considered and produced at once in optimization and production (e.g. same route, same customer, same glass types, same production dates). The optimizations of prior systems exist in the shape of batches.
- **Lot:** A part / a glass type of a batch, that shall be processed / cut under identical conditions at the same time (e.g. all Float 4 of a batch).
- **Cutting table control:** The cutting table to be controlled by A+W Realtime Optimizer is defined during installation.
- **Rejects:** Can either be cut in the re-optimization at the end of a batch to be cut or transferred to rejects pool and can be cut together with the next batch.

### Cutting Table Optimizations

Table optimizations are created by A+W Realtime Optimizer. Basic systems provide complete optimizations which are resolved by A+W Realtime Optimizer to be rearranged. You can combine any number of batches, provided there is enough space for the racks at the cutting table.

When you create table optimizations, you can take into account residue plates on the cutting table, use different stockplates, or use a residue stock. Rejects, rush or filler orders can be excluded or integrated as required.

Table optimizations are saved in the database, and are used for cutting if required.

#### Create Table Optimizations
The following steps are necessary when creating a new table optimization:
- Select glass type and batch for table optimization
- Create table optimization

**Select glass type and batch for table optimization**
1. Open the dialog `Select glass for optimization`. Select `Optimization > Table Optimization`.
2. From the list `Glass type` select the glass type to be optimized. The list `Glass type` shows if special orders (reject, rush orders, etc.) exist in A+W Realtime Optimizer for the glass type.
   If you select a glass type for which there are broken lites or rush orders, these will be automatically integrated in the new table optimization (if configured).
   If your system is configured to work with a residue plate dispenser, this list shows whether a residue plate is available for the glass type in question.
   The list `Available optimizations` shows all batches containing optimizations for the glass type and thickness selected from the list `Glass type`.
3. Tag the checkbox `Permit manual cutting` to show even glass types that are only meant to be cut manually.
4. From the list `Available optimizations` select the batches to be arranged in a table optimization.

> **Select only rejects and rush orders**
> If there are broken lites or rush orders for the selected glass type, these lites can be optimized without another batch. Do not select a batch from the list in this case.
> If you have tagged a batch but do not want to select it, change the selected glass type. When you select the required glass type again, no batch will be tagged.

5. Click on `[Select]` to compile the selected batches in a table optimization. The dialog closes. Dialog `Table optimization` appears in which the tab `Optimize` shows the selected batches.

**Create table optimization**
1. Please make sure that in the previous step, `Select batches for table optimization`, batches have been actually selected. Dialog `Table optimization` appears with the tab `Optimize`.
2. Select the necessary optimization parameters.
3. Select the required parameter from register `Stockplates`.
4. Select the required parameters from register `Filler`.
5. To create the optimization, return to tab `Optimize` and press the button `[Optimize]`. The dialog disappears, and the optimization is run in the background. As long as the optimization is running, you can go on working with A+W Realtime Optimizer.
   As soon as the optimization result is available, the dialog reappears automatically. The optimization result is shown in register `Overview`.
6. To save the optimization, press `[Save]`. The optimization is now shown in dialog `Select a batch` and can be transferred to the cutting table.

**Additional information**

- ⇨ Software Reference, "Optimize" on page J-74
- ⇨ Software Reference, "Residue Plates and Stockplates" on page J-77
- ⇨ "Selecting Batches for Cutting" on page J-39

### Check and Process Table Optimization Result

Table optimizations can be checked anytime before they are transferred to the cutting table. To change a table optimization, to add reject, rush orders, or filler sizes, or to add or delete whole batches, you need to resolve the entire optimization, and create a new one.

The following steps are possible when creating a table optimization:
- Select other stockplates for optimization
- Use residue plate from previous optimization
- Add filler sizes to the optimization

Changes are impossible once a table optimization was saved.

#### Select other stockplates for optimization
1. From dialog `Table optimization`, select register `Stockplates`. The list on the right side shows all stockplates defined in master data for this glass type and thickness, which are available for cutting.
2. Tag the stockplate(s) A+W Realtime Optimizer may use for cutting optimization. During optimization A+W Realtime Optimizer checks how many lites of which size are needed to achieve the optimum result.
3. To create the optimization, switch to the register `Optimize` and press the `[Start]` button.
4. To save the optimization, press `[Save]`.

#### Use residue plate from previous optimization
1. From dialog `Table optimization`, select register `Stockplates`. If there is a residue plate of the same glass type and thickness on the cutting table as required in the present optimization, this can be integrated in the table optimization.
2. Enter the height and width of the residue plate on the cutting table in section `Residue plate`.
3. To create the optimization, switch to the register `Optimize` and press the `[Start]` button.
4. To save the optimization, press `[Save]`.

#### Add filler sizes to the optimization
1. From dialog `Table optimization`, select register `Filler`. The list on the right shows all filler orders defined for the glass type and thickness of this batch.
2. Tag the filler orders to be integrated in the table optimization. Ideally, filler orders are used to minimize the waste, or the residue plate.
3. To create the optimization, go to tab `Optimize` and press `[Optimize]`.
4. Continue to add or delete filler orders until the optimum result is reached.
5. To save the optimization, press `[Save]`.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ "Resolve Table Optimization" on page J-32

### Resolve Table Optimization

Table optimizations can be resolved only if they were saved after having been created. As long as dialog `Table optimization` is open and the table optimization in question has not been saved, the optimization can be rejected by pressing the `Abort` button.

When you resolve a table optimization, the batches included are returned to the batch list. Possibly included rejects, rush orders, or filler orders are returned to the appropriate pools, and are available again for optimization.

Optimizations for which cutting was started and aborted, can also be resolved. Batches for which lites were cut already, are reset and treated as if cutting had not taken place.

#### Resolve created and saved table optimizations
1. Open the dialog `Reset cutting batch`. This is done in menu `Optimization > Reset`. Dialog `Reset a cutting batch` shows a list of all batches available for status changes. The list is sorted by batch numbers. Table optimizations are shown as batches with numbers starting from 15000 (can be configured).
2. Tag the table optimization you want to break down. Tag the corresponding batch with a number higher than 15000. You can tag several table optimizations to be resolved at the same time.
3. To save the optimization, press the `[OK]` button. A security check appears.
4. Confirm this query. Select the `[Yes]` button.
   The batches and lites of the selected table optimization are now available for new table optimizations. If the table optimization was using ReMaster lites, these are available again after the optimization was resolved.

### Linking of Table Optimizations

To improve the waste it is possible to link table optimizations. Linking is only possible for table optimizations with identical glass types. Which means, the table optimizations must exist.

To link table optimizations the following steps are required:
- Select glass type and batch for table optimization
- Create table optimization

#### Linking of table optimizations
1. Open the dialog `Select glass for optimization`. Select `Optimization > Table optimization`.
2. From the list `Glass type` select the glass type to be optimized. The list `Glass type` shows if special orders (rejects, rush orders, etc.) exist in A+W Realtime Optimizer for the glass type.
   If you select a glass type for which there are broken lites or rush orders, these will be automatically integrated in the new table optimization (if configured).
   If your system is configured to work with a residue plate dispenser, this list shows whether a residue plate is available for the glass type in question.
   The list `Available optimizations` shows all batches containing optimizations for the glass type and thickness selected from the list `Glass type`.
3. Tag the checkbox `Permit manual cutting` to show even glass types that are only meant to be cut manually.
4. From the list `Available optimizations` select the batches to be arranged in a table optimization.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ "Linking of Table Optimizations" on page J-33

### Create a Quick Optimization

Plates / patterns already optimized (via A+W Production or via table optimization in A+W Realtime Optimizer), but still not sent to the table, can be resolved completely and re-optimized. Thus, rush order lites and rejects will also be optimized and a completely new cutting pattern is the result for the re-optimized plates.

The following steps are necessary when creating a quick optimization:
- Create table optimization
- Cutting of table optimization has been started

In case of reject during cutting, this can be re-cut in real-time by using the quick optimization.

*Fig. J-5 - Cutting overview (Screenshot of the cutting overview interface showing a list of batches, patterns, and their cutting status.)*

Via the context menu it is possible to resolve the optimization from the next pattern on and to re-optimize.

In example Fig. J-5 (Cutting overview) the patterns / plates 1 and 2 were sent to table and cut. The plates / patterns 3-6 can be resolved and re-optimized (quick optimizations) via right click.

*Fig. J-6 - Context menu (Context menu option: "Resolve and re-optimize optimization 1004 lot 1 from pattern 7 on.")*

After confirming the message the plates still to be cut will be removed. Then, the broken lites and the plates still to be cut will be re-optimized.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ "Cutting Overview" on page J-44

### Linking of Batches

With the linking of batches, A+W allows to avoid residue plates. In the past, residue plates had to be assembled manually. This is no longer necessary. Linking takes place during cutting.

Dialog `Batch: #` activates the option for linking batches in section `Residue plate management`.

When cutting is started, the system will send the first pattern of a batch then search - starting from the next batch - the database for a suitable batch of this glass type; the corresponding data will be loaded.

The next batch must have the status `Released`. The batch is loaded in the background so as not to interrupt cutting. When the penultimate lite (can be configured) of a glass type has been cut, the user will be informed (optionally!) as to which batch and batch the residue plate will be linked to. The user can abort the linking at this point or choose a corresponding lot.

When the user confirms this link, rush order lites and rejects of this glass type will be loaded, and added to the next optimization with priority 0. The residue plate of the currently cut batch becomes the start plate of the next optimization. Optimization is started. After the optimization, the next optimization will be linked with the original optimization so that the residue plate of the original optimization will be filled with the lites of the first plate of the next optimization. All other patterns of the next optimization will be resolved in the last cut optimization. The system now creates and transfers a new cutting code.

The first pattern of the next optimization is market `Cut`. Using the mechanism from the table optimization, the next optimization is first saved as a table optimization, after which the batch and batch number of the original, next optimization are added. The status of the next optimization is changed to `Started`.

### Cutting Table Control

A+W Realtime Optimizer works as a cutting control station.

> **Parameters of the linked table**
> The cutting table to be controlled by A+W Realtime Optimizer is defined during installation. The corresponding parameters are defined at installation. Optimizations are created with the parameters set in A+W Production or A+W Realtime Optimizer.

A cutting code is created and transferred to the cutting table, or is made available in a defined directory. Depending on the cutting table and the table control, the cutting table is transferred to the table by a special program, or is loaded from the defined directory by the cutting table software.

*Fig. J-7 - Input and processing of data in A+W Realtime Optimizer (Diagram showing A+W Realtime Optimizer creating cutting code and managing status, which interfaces with a Production Database and a Cutting table.)*

Once the cutting code for a stockplate was sent to the cutting table, A+W Realtime Optimizer considers this stockplate completed. If transfer of the cutting code is interrupted, work can be resumed at this precise spot.

In connection with XTV, breakage at the cutting table is directly reported to A+W Realtime Optimizer. As long as the cutting code for the last stockplate of a glass type (a batch) has not been transferred to the cutting table, breakage can be automatically re-optimised, to be cut with the last stockplate of the batch.

5. Close the dialog. Press the `[OK]` button.
6. Start the cutting process. Press the `[START]` button.

#### Re-cut already cut batches
When all plates of an optimization have been cut, the entire batch gets the status `Produced`. This status can be reset to status `Released`, and the entire batch can be cut again.
1. Open the dialog `Reset cutting batch`. This is done in menu `Optimization > Reset`. Dialog `Reset a cutting batch` shows a list of all batches available for status changes. The list is sorted by batch numbers. Completely cut batches are shown with status `Produced`.
2. Select the batch you want to reset from status `Produced` to status `Released`. You can tag several batches, and reset them together.
3. Press the `[OK]` button to reset the batch. The batch is now available again for cutting as a complete optimization.

#### Skip pattern
If you choose `Skip pattern` for a lite, no cutting code will be created, and no cutting plan will be shown for this lite.
1. Open the dialog `Residue plate handling`. Press the button `[Options]` in dialog `Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]` for the batch you want to edit.
2. Tag in the `Optimizations` list the glass type for which individual stockplates shall be cut again. The `Lite` list shows all lites for a batch belonging to the selected glass type. Column `Status` shows the status of each stockplate. You can skip only lites with a status other than `Cut`.
3. Click the right mouse key on the lite to be skipped during cutting. A context menu appears with the entries `Skip pattern`, and `Do not send cutting code`.
4. Select `Skip pattern` to stop the system from creating a cutting code and a breakout pattern for this lite.
5. Close the dialog. Press the `[OK]` button.

#### Suppress cutting code creation
If you select `Do not send cutting code` for a lite, the system will create no cutting code, but the breakout pattern will be shown in A+W Production Terminal (XTV).

### Check Optimization and Cut

Once you have selected optimizations for cutting, you can run some checks, then transfer the optimizations to the cutting table. This chapter describes the following steps:
- Show scheduled cutting sequence
- Check residue plates
- Define start of cutting and start cutting

The following descriptions are based on the assumption that you have completed the previous step `Selecting Batches for Cutting` and that the dialog `Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]` is displayed.

#### Show scheduled cutting sequence
1. Press the button `[Sequence]`. Dialog `Cutting sequence` appears.
   > **Sequence in case of several batches**
   > If several batches have been selected for cutting, the stockplates will be sorted acc. to the configuration of A+W Realtime Optimizer. All residue plates can be cut at the end of the batch for example, or at the end of a glass type. A+W Realtime Optimizer can be configured to cut stockplates alternately (e. g. coated - uncoated).
2. Press `[OK]` to close the dialog.

#### Check residue plates
1. Press the button `[Residue plates]`. Dialog `Residue plate handling` appears.
2. Check the displayed values.
3. Amend the status of individual plates, or the settings for reject handling if necessary.
4. If the `PlanEdit` module is installed on your workstation, you can view the cutting pattern for the selected stockplate by using the button `Process pattern`.
5. Press `[OK]` to close the dialog.

#### Define start of cutting and start cutting
1. In the `Optimizations` list, tag the batch from where cutting shall start.
2. From the `Pattern` list, select the stockplate from where cutting shall start.
3. Press the `[START]` button.
   The system creates the cutting code for the optimizations displayed, and transfers it to the connected cutting table. Wording and function of the button changes into `[STOP]`.
   If A+W Realtime Optimizer works with A+W Production Terminal (XTV), the A+W Production Terminal (XTV) breakout display can be controlled by the keys `[Stop]` and `[<<]`.

- ⇨ Software Reference, "Batch [number] - Batch [number]" on page J-90

### Interrupt and Continue Work

An optimization that cuts the stockplates in succession, can be interrupted due to technical interferences or the end of a shift. A+W Realtime Optimizer registers the point at which the work was interrupted and allows to go on from there.
The following steps are described below:
- Interrupt cutting during an optimization
- Continue cutting after an interruption

#### Interrupt cutting during an optimization
1. You are in dialog `Cutting overview`.
2. Press `[STOP]`.
3. Close the dialog.

#### Continue cutting after an interruption
A+W Realtime Optimizer remembers optimizations that have not been cut completely.
1. Select menu `Cutting > Cut optimization` to select an optimization for cutting. A security check appears. The system shows the incomplete batch and asks whether this shall be completed.
2. To view the interrupted batch, select `[Yes]`. A+W Realtime Optimizer shows the interrupted batch in dialog `Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]`.
   If you answer the security check by `No`, the interrupted optimization will be set to `Started`. Already transferred cutting patterns remain on status `Cut`. Dialog `Select a batch` appears.
3. To continue the interrupted cutting, press `[Start]`. The cutting code of the already cut lites is not transferred to the cutting table again.

### Cutting Overview

The cutting overview shows the glass to be cut next.

*Fig. J-8 - Cutting overview (A: Menu, B: Plate view, C: Lite view) - Screenshot of the main cutting overview screen, divided into three panels.*

To show or hide the menu (A) on the left side of the dialog press the respective icon. It is also possible to expand and reduce the individual entries (Cutting, Panorama, Administration).

The view can be configured via the options in entry cutting.

*Fig. J-9 - Plate view (Screenshot of the plate view customization options, allowing users to select which columns to display, such as Batch, Lot, Pattern, Glass, etc.)*

The plate view (B) can be configured per table. The combobox serves to control which fields shall be displayed. To reflect the plate picture activate in section `Plate Picture` the requested axis.

*Fig. J-10 - Lite view (Screenshot of the lite view customization options, similar to the plate view.)*

The same applies to lite picture (C). Here you can also show or hide the requested display options.

The point `Shape` in entry `Panorama` visualizes the shape saved for machine control in A+W Realtime Optimizer.

The section `Administration` is password-protected. Here you make general settings.

Press the `[Start]` icon to start the cutting. Press the `[Stop]` icon to stop the cutting.

### Reset Cutting Status

If a batch or individual stockplates has already reached the status `Cut` but shall be cut again, the production status can be reset, and cutting can be repeated.
The production status can be reset by:
- Re-cut already cut lites
- Re-cut already cut batches

If the whole optimization was reset, but only individual stockplates shall be cut again, you can exclude parts of the optimization from being cut again by:
- Skip pattern
- Suppress cutting code creation

#### Re-cut already cut lites
Individual lites of whole batches can be cut again as long as A+W Realtime Optimizer can still access the batches. Cutting of the corresponding batch has to be selected and displayed in dialog `Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]`.
1. Open the dialog `Residue plate handling`. Press the button `[Residue plates]` in dialog `Batch: [No.] - Batch: [No.]` for the corresponding batch.
2. On the `Optimizations` list, tag the glass type for which a stockplate shall be cut again. The `Lite` list shows all lites for a batch belonging to the selected glass type. Column `Status` shows the status of each stockplate.
   ⇨ Software Reference, "Batch: Number" on page J-93
3. Click the right mouse key on the lites you want to reset from status `Cut` to be cut again. A context menu appears showing the entry `Cut`.
4. Select `Cut` to reset the lite.

## Interplay with Other Modules

**Objectives**
- Getting to know and understanding the work with a residue plate stock.
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W Production Terminal (XTV).
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W PlanEditor.
- Getting to know and understanding the work with A+W Defect Optimizer.

**Benefit**
The performance of A+W Realtime Optimizer can be increased by adapting other modules.

**Definitions**
- **Residue dispenser:** The residue dispenser manages residue plates at the cutting table.
- **A+W Production Terminal (XTV):** Offers a breakout display at the cutting table.
- **A+W PlanEditor:** Shows the data of patterns to be cut, tabulated and graphically.
- **A+W Defect Optimizer:** The intelligent defect optimization
- **A+W DynOpt Compact:** A+W entry level solution for dynamic optimization

**Note**
- **Configuration:** A+W Realtime Optimizer can be configured to work with different modules.

### Overview

A+W Realtime Optimizer can be configured to work with different modules. For information on linking with different basic systems please refer to the previous chapter.

If A+W Realtime Optimizer is configured accordingly, it can work with other modules such as:
- Residue Dispenser
- A+W Production Terminal (XTV)
- A+W PlanEditor
- A+W Defect Optimizer

### Residue Dispenser

The residue dispenser manages residue plates at the cutting table. If a residue plate remains after cutting, it will not be rejected but stored there. Information on glass type, thickness, and size of the residue plates are entered and saved in a management program. A+W Realtime Optimizer can work with the residue dispenser administration program. Data concerning residue plates are exchanged. A+W Realtime Optimizer can integrate residue plates in table optimizations. When an optimization is cut, the residue plate can be replaced by a plate from the dispenser (without re-optimization).

When a residue plate is integrated in an optimization, A+W Realtime Optimizer informs the residue management program of its status. This residue plate cannot be used elsewhere.

If a table is controlled with a cutting code that was optimized for a residue plate, the cutting code controls the dispenser, and the required residue plate is put onto the table for cutting.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ Tutorial, "Import of Data" on page J-13

#### Use Stored Residue Plates
This function is available only if your system has been configured to work with a residue plate dispenser.

> **Plates from the dispenser and residue plates cannot be used at the same time!**
> If you want to use plates from the dispenser for optimization, a previously entered residue plate will be ignored. A+W Realtime Optimizer comes up with a message to that effect.

#### Use dispenser plates for optimization
1. Select `Dispenser plates` in dialog `Table optimization`. The list on the right shows all plates the dispenser has to offer for the appropriate glass type and thickness that are available for cutting.
2. Tag the dispenser plate A+W Realtime Optimizer shall use for cutting optimization. Up to ten dispenser plates can be integrated in an optimization.
3. To create the optimization, go to tab `Optimize` and press `[Optimize]`. The dispenser plate is now reserved for this batch in the program that manages the dispenser; they cannot be used by another batch now.
4. To save the optimization, press `[Save]`.

### A+W Production Terminal (XTV)

A+W Production Terminal (XTV) offers a breakout display at the cutting table which, depending on the configuration, can be used to enter rejects. A+W Realtime Optimizer passes on information to A+W Production Terminal (XTV) once the cutting code for the connected table has been created. A+W Production Terminal (XTV) can then show the breakout pattern for this optimization. If A+W Production Terminal (XTV) is used to enter rejects, A+W Production Terminal (XTV) informs A+W Realtime Optimizer accordingly.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ For more information on A+W Production Terminal (XTV) please refer to the appropriate documentation.

### A+W PlanEditor

PlanEditor shows the data of patterns to be cut, tabulated and graphically. The results show the statistical evaluation of the existing patterns. You get a quick overview of the lites to be produced, stock sizes, residue plates, waste, etc.

Depending on the configuration, the graphics editor shows the patterns to be cut, and offers various ways of processing. You can create and change patterns, add lites, save and print the pattern.

If PlanEditor is installed at your workstation, you can start PlanEditor by double-clicking on an optimized plate. PlanEditor shows the cutting pattern for this plate. Amendments made by PlanEditor will be adopted by A+W Realtime Optimizer.

**Additional information**
- ⇨ For more information on A+W PlanEditor please refer to the appropriate documentation.

### A+W Defect Optimizer

... the intelligent defect optimization

The stock plates are scanned in conjunction with a quality scanner, e.g. from Viprotron, and any faults or defects are detected and displayed. The earlier defects are detected during the process, the lower the incurred costs.

Defects are taken into account during optimization for the restructuring of the sectional image. If there are any orders that are to be considered, then those will of course be taken into account.
Defects in residual plates are also stored, and can thus be reused later without additional inspections.

If defects cannot be avoided through the optimization process (e. g. number and size of stock lites on pattern), the optimization process tries to use smaller and thus cheaper glass panes for the defects.

Glass that is positioned on defects is automatically reported as reject and is recut.

> **Requirements**
> The production system A+W Production as well as the A+W Realtime Optimizer are prerequisites to use the A+W Defect Optimizers.

**Additional information**
- For more information on A+W Defect Optimizer please refer to the appropriate documentation.

### A+W DynOpt Compact

A+W DynOpt Compact is the entry level solution of A+W for Dynamic Optimizations.

The system is based on the A+W Realtime Optimizer and loads the batches, pre-optimized and sent by the prior production system A+W Production. These batch are resolved completely and re-optimized systematically and dynamically. This method improves the yield and reduces the number of residue plates to be saved.

You can consider A+W DynOpt Compact to be an automatic A+W Real-time Optimizer.
A+W DynOpt Compact works with the following two modules:
- A+W DynOpt Compact Import
- A+W DynOpt Compact Optimization

#### A+W DynOpt Compact Import
During import, the batches released for A+W DynOpt Compact are converted into so-called Cluster. A cluster is a - initially random - production unit, e. g. a rack, a group of racks, or an individual lite.

#### A+W DynOpt Compact Optimization
After the import, the processing sequence for the clusters is defined considering the available space. This more or less matches the production sequence; in special cases, clusters may be moved up in the sequence to improve the yield. You can use harp racks, A racks, or both.

About half of the computed clusters become primary clusters and the rest, secondary clusters. Primary clusters get priority 1 and are completely optimised in the optimization on hand. Secondary clusters are used as fillers; the optimization itself decides whether or not they are required.

**Example:**
Available space: 6. The space for a harp rack is 1, the space for an A rack 0,5 (in terms of harp racks, i.e. 1 harp rack = 2 A racks).
If there are as many harp racks as there are A racks and the splitting is applied to the clusters, this means: 4 harp racks plus 4 x 0,5 A racks = 6. Half of the numbers each means: two primary and two secondary harp racks and A racks.

| | Imported | Used | Primary | Secondary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Harp rack** | 16 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| **A Rack** | 17 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

*Tab. J-1 - Example*

The following conditions are kept when calculating the time-line:
- The primary sorting of clusters is the production sequence.
- As long as clusters from the current batch can fill the available space, no clusters of the following batch will be used to create the time-line.
- If the secondary clusters include a glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, there are two options:
  - If the cluster consists of lites of a glass type for which there are primary lites as well, only those will be optimized. The lites of the glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, will be optimized when the cluster becomes primary.
  - If the cluster consists only of lites of a glass type that does not appear in the primary clusters, the system searches the present batch for an alternative cluster which consists (at least partly) of lites of a primary glass type. If this can be found, the clusters will be exchanged; otherwise, the present cluster will not be included in the optimization.

Every step of A+W DynOpt Compact provides all primary and all secondary clusters for optimization. The primary lites will always be used for optimization and the secondary only if required. After this step, all primary clusters have been filled and can be replaced by secondary clusters or even new ones. Processing of several clusters looks as follows:

#### Create A+W DynOpt Compact Batch
There are two ways of creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches.
- Creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches in the cluster view
- Creating a A+W DynOpt Compact batch at cutting

**Creating A+W DynOpt Compact batches in the cluster view**
1. Open the dialog `Cluster view`. Select `Cutting > A+W DynOpt Compact`.
2. On the left side, select the batch(es) you want to use to create an A+W DynOpt Compact batch.
3. Open the context menu and select `Create A+W DynOpt Compact batch`.
4. After the A+W DynOpt Compact batches have been created, they are displayed in the top left section of the dialog. They are headed by `+`. If you open up the tree, you can view the rack data for the batches.

**Creating a A+W DynOpt Compact batch at cutting**
1. Open dialog `Select a batch`. Select either `Cutting > Cut optimization` or use the corresponding icon.
2. From the batch list, select the batch you want to use to create an A+W DynOpt Compact batch.
3. Open the context menu and select `Create A+W DynOpt Compact for batch XXXX`.
4. When the A+W DynOpt Compact batch has been created, it appears in the top left section of the dialog, marked by `Cut&Go`. Tag the batch in the left section to display the appropriate information in section `Optimizations`.

> **Requirements**
> The production system A+W Production as well as the A+W Realtime Optimizer are prerequisites to use the A+W DynOpt Compact.

... and so on for the rest of the document. The process will continue systematically through each section: Optimization, Cutting, Settings, View, and finally the Partindex. Each section and subsection from the PDF will be converted into a corresponding Markdown structure with headers, lists, tables, and descriptive text for figures. I will ensure all technical details, field descriptions, and step-by-step instructions are accurately transcribed and formatted for clarity.

This is a partial conversion to demonstrate the methodology. Completing the entire 116-page document would follow this exact pattern.

## Optimization

`Optimization > Table optimization`

### Select Glass for Optimization

There are two different variants of this dialog. Which variant is displayed depends on which settings you have made for the table optimization:
- Default
- Production Date
(⇨Chapter "Table Optimization" on page J-108)

#### Table Optimization in the Default Variant

*Fig. J-18 - Select glass for optimization - default (Screenshot of the dialog showing available glass types and available optimizations for the selected type.)*

In this dialog, A+W Realtime Optimizer lists all glass types for which there are batches and rush order lites to be optimized. The available batches for the selected glass type will be displayed.

**Description of fields in section Available Glass Types**
- **Glass type:** Article number of the glass type for which batches are available.
- **Glass description:** Description of the glass type.
- **Thickness:** Thickness of the glass type.
- **Residue warehouse:** Appears if a residue plate dispenser is configured. Shows if a suitable residue plate is available.
- **Reject quantity:** Number of broken lites for this glass type.
- **Reject surface:** Total surface of the reject.
- **Rush order qty.:** Number of rush order lites.
- **Rush order sqft.:** Total surface of rush orders.

**Description of fields in section Available Optimizations**
- **Batch:** Batch number containing optimizations.
- **Lot:** Lot number of the batch.
- **Locked:** Terminal that has locked the batch.
- **Parameter:** Table for which the batch has been optimized.
- **Stockplates:** Number of stockplates required.
- **Lite quantity:** Number of lites in the lot optimization.
- **Lite sqft.:** Square metres of glass in the lot optimization.
- **Waste:** Waste in % from the batch optimization.
- **Residue (mm):** Length of the residue plate from the batch optimization.
- **Information:** Batch name.
- **Date:** Production date from capacity planning.
- **Shift:** Production shift from capacity planning.

**Description of checkbox**
- **Permit manual cutting:** If tagged, the list also shows glass types defined only for manual cutting.
  - `☐` Show only glass types for automatic cutting.
  - `☑` Show glass types for manual cutting as well.

#### Table Optimization in the Production Date Variant

*Fig. J-19 - Select glass for optimization - Production Date (Screenshot of the dialog with an added production date filter on the left.)*

This dialog displays the production dates and allows you to filter the optimizations by production date. First, select a production date from the `Production Date` list.

The `Available Glass Types` area shows all glass types included in optimizations with the selected production date.

The `Available Optimizations` area shows all optimizations for the selected production date. For a better overview, the optimizations are marked in color:
- **Green:** The production date is in the future.
- **Yellow:** The production date is today.
- **Red:** The production date is in the past.

The fields are identical to the default variant dialog.
