### A+W Clarity Reference  
Reflex

My father always used to strive for the optimum production solution. This also applies to the software we are using. We have therefore been using A+W software for more than 30 years, and have never looked back. Another important criterion for us is service. At A+W, this is solution-oriented; their experts know their job and communicate excellently with our staff and machinery partners.

### A+W Clarity Reference

The A+W software controls and checks all processes from entry of the order to control of the machines, on through to delivery of the finished products. Thanks to consistent barcode control and the A+W Production Monitors, we always know where each sheet is at any point in time. All commercial and technical data is available company-wide – and this without having employees running around all the time with folders and stacks of paper under their arms in order to determine what they must do with which sheet (…) All employees work productively! The focus is always on information, all the time and everywhere.
