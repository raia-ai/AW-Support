For the first time, all processes from order entry, order processing, and production control up to dispatch are networked.  
In 1997, A+W develops a program which makes disks, labels, and paperwork on the shop floor dispensable: ALCIM.  
Production was revolutionized by ALCIM in 1997 because information was available right where it was required. Order processing data are available online at the cutting lines, benders, sealing robots, and applicators. Monitors on the shop floor are a complete novelty.  
A+W still revolutionize production with similar systems. Needless to say that the cooperation with machinery manufacturers is as close as ever.
