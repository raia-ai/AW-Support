#### "A+W is a reliable partner that continues to enhance its products and offer new solutions. A+W has many interface solutions with other providers and it works exceedingly well with all machine partners."

#### Thorsten Hoffmann

##### \- HoffmannGlas GmbH & Co. KG

## Investment in state-of-the-art machine technology

The company HoffmannGlas has started up a Forel insulated glass line in its Halle /Peißen plant – this is the first one anywhere in Germany. At the same time, an automatic edging machine, also from Forel, is being integrated into an existing insulated glass line that is designed for jumbo dimensions, that is, large-format shaped sheets. This is how the HoffmannGlas Group can offer its customers, especially those in the demanding project business, even more services in the future. All of the new systems are controlled by A+W interfaces.

HoffmannGlas has been an A+W customer for 24 years. Along the way, we have learned that this corporate group always cooperates in the innovation network with mechanical engineering firms and with A+W as software partner, and with a sense of proportion, it has always made the right investments.
