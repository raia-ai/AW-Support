Requirements such as adherence to delivery dates, flexibility and short delivery times are becoming more and more important, competing in this vein with factors such as quality and costs.

## Strong and independent partner for more than a century

Float Glass Industries is a key independent manufacturer of insulated glazing and flat glass wholesaler, which has been implementing complex A+W systems for many years. The production environment of Float Glass Industries is a highly integrated system consisting of the best machinery and a complex A+W production control.

The Glaston CNC processing system receives data online via the A+W Production system online in the CAM-DXF format. CAM-DXF “knows” the tools, vacuum position, etc. that are necessary for the respective processing, transfers the information online to the machines and saves us a considerable amount of time and expenses.

The FGI machine park is equipped with a state-of-the-art barcoding system from cutting to shipping. Because of this, the processing status of every sheet is known at all times.

In shipping, exact packing lists are created on the basis of the barcode registration and sent to the customer via EDI. The packing information is thus directly captured by the customer’s IT system and not attached as a paper form to the shipping rack. This increases security and the availability of information.
