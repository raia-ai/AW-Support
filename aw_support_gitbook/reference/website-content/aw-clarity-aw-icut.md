## About the Product

In the digital age of Industry 4.0, small- and medium-sized companies are recognizing the need to digitalize their processes to stay up with their customers and compete with their competition. Are you one of those small- or medium-sized companies? Are you looking for a state-of-the-art, compact, cost-effective IT solution that automates your most-used office, storage, and cutting functions? If so, then A+W iCut could be your answer! It is A+W’s newest integrated software system, which could be your first step toward digitalizing your company.

A+W iCut is a compact solution for glass manufacturers and processors that integrates commercial programs with state-of-the-art cutting optimization. You can use A+W iCut to enter orders, optimize your glass cutting, manage your glass storage, and automatically synchronize with optimization after cutting, which automates your inventory.

With A+W iCut, you can quickly and easily create products all while using a simple interface to enter different glass types. In order to calculate the correct cutting dimensions, you enter the required edge processing. Do you have to enter a shape? No problem – the standard shapes of the A+W shape catalog are a component of this software solution. For the entry of shaped sheets that are not included in the shape catalog (a.k.a., shape 99), there is a DXF import function. All of these functions together allow you to calculate the total price of an order.

Equipment is important for the completion of each job. All commercially available cutting tables can be controlled using A+W iCut. With appropriate additional drivers, you can also control additional cutting tables. Broken sheets are re-optimized manually with A+W iCut. Additionally, there are also functions for printing labels and visualizing cutting plans.

Another crucial feature of A+W iCut is a system for managing residual plates. By managing residual plates, you can ensure that in addition to stock plates, the optimization also considers your valuable residual plates in order to achieve the best yield.

One of the best features of A+W iCut is that when your requirements increase, your software solution can “grow along” if you’d like it to. An upgrade to A+W Business Pro is possible at any time – for example, if your company grows, if you have to manage more customers and products, if you need more workstations and functions. You can also integrate optional add-ons for your existing A+W iCut, such as barcoding / sheet tracking, and A+W iShape for quick and easy digitalization of templates.
