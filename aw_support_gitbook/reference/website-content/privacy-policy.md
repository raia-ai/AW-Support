We also reserve the right to check the files if there is a justified suspicion of unlawful use or a specific attack on the pages based on concrete evidence. In this case, our legitimate interest is processing for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting such attacks and unlawful use.

**Use of cookies**

We use cookies. Cookies are data that can be stored in the Internet browser or by the Internet browser on the user’s computer system and retrieved again when visiting a website. Cookies may contain a characteristic string of characters that enables the browser to be uniquely identified when the website or an integrated service is called up again. We use cookies to enable the operation of our website (technically necessary cookies), to make our website more user-friendly (functional cookies) and for marketing and advertising purposes (advertising cookies).

Technical cookies: Some elements of our website require that the accessing browser can be identified even after a page change. The purpose of their use is to enable the website to function at all. Examples of technically necessary cookies are the provision of a shopping cart or logging in as a registered user. The processing is therefore carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or f GDPR.

Functional cookies: There may be functions that are not absolutely technically necessary for the operation of our website, but which considerably simplify its use, such as the adoption of language settings or font sizes, the remembering of search terms, etc.. The processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or f GDPR.

Advertising cookies: We also use cookies on some of our websites that enable us to analyze the surfing behavior of users. In this way, for example: search terms entered in search engines, frequency of page views, use of website functions, and information about the operating system and browser, etc. are transmitted. The user data collected in this way is pseudonymized by technical precautions. It is therefore no longer possible to assign the data to the accessing user. The data is not stored together with other personal data of the user. The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies for analysis purposes is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR if the user has consented to this – e.g. by making a selection in a cookie opt-in banner – otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If third-party services are integrated, processing by them is governed by their respective data protection provisions, which are mentioned and/or linked below.

**Google Analytics**

If you have given your consent, this website uses Google Analytics 4, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. The controller for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information collected by the cookies about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. In Google Analytics 4, the anonymization of IP addresses is activated by default. Due to IP anonymization, your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. According to Google, the IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. During your visit to the website, your user behavior is recorded in the form of “events”. Events can be: page views, first visit to the website, start of the session, interaction with the website, scrolls, clicks on external links, internal search queries, interaction with videos, file downloads, ads viewed/clicked on, language setting.

The following is also recorded Your approximate location (region), your IP address (in abbreviated form), technical information about your browser and the end devices you use (e.g. language setting, screen resolution), your internet provider, the referrer URL (via which website/advertising medium you came to this website) On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your pseudonymous use of the website and to compile reports on website activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyze the performance of our website

Recipients of the data are/may be Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (as processor pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR); Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; Alphabet Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. It cannot be ruled out that US authorities may access the data stored by Google. Insofar as data is processed outside the EU/EEA and there is no level of data protection corresponding to the European standard, we have concluded [EU standard contractual clauses](https://business.safety.google/adsprocessorterms/sccs/eu-c2p/) with the service provider to establish an appropriate level of data protection. The parent company of Google Ireland, Google LLC, is based in California, USA. A transfer of data to the USA and access by US authorities to the data stored by Google cannot be ruled out. The USA is currently considered a third country from a data protection perspective. You do not have the same rights there as within the EU/EEA. You may not be entitled to any legal remedies against access by authorities. Data transmission to the USA is currently based on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, according to which Google is certified. The data sent by us and linked to cookies is automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month. The legal basis for this data processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future by accessing the [cookie settings](#uc-corner-modal-show) and changing your selection there. The lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation remains unaffected.

You can find more information on the terms of use of Google Analytics and on data protection at Google at [https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/de/](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/de/) and at [https://policies.google.com/?hl=de.](https://policies.google.com/?hl=de.)

**Demographic characteristics in Google Analytics**

This website uses the “demographic characteristics” function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be created that contain statements about the age, gender and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and from visitor data from third-party providers. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can deactivate this function at any time via the ad settings in your Google account or generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics.

**Google Analytics Remarketing**

Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

This function makes it possible to link the advertising target groups created with Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device functions of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to you depending on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. cell phone) can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).

If you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on every device on which you sign in with your Google account.

To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated user IDs that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device advertising.

You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account by following this link: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/)

The summary of the data collected in your Google account is based exclusively on your consent, which you can give or revoke at Google (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). For data collection processes that are not merged in your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merging), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymized analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.

Further information and the data protection provisions can be found in Google’s privacy policy at: [https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

**Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking**

This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).

As part of Google AdWords, we use what is known as conversion tracking. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie is set for conversion tracking. Cookies are small text files that the Internet browser stores on the user’s computer. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used to personally identify the user. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.

Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to this use by easily deactivating the Google Conversion Tracking cookie via your Internet browser under user settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.

The storage of “conversion cookies” is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.

You can find more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking in Google’s privacy policy: [https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/) .

You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.

**Google reCAPTCHA**

We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).

The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form) is made by a human or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, time spent on the website by the website visitor or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.

The reCAPTCHA analyses run completely in the background. Website visitors are not informed that an analysis is taking place. Data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its website from abusive automated spying and SPAM.

Further information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google’s privacy policy can be found at the following links: [https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/) and [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html).

**Google Tag Manager**

We use Google Tag Manager on this website. Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows marketers to manage website tags via an interface. The tool that implements the tags is a cookie-less domain. This means that Google Tag Manager does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation is carried out at domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags that are implemented with Google Tag Manager. The use of Google Tag Manager makes it easier to use our website.

Further data protection information on the use of Google Tag Manager can be found at [https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/) .

Data processing takes place on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from our e-mail notifications. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.

The data you provide us with for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from both our servers and HubSpot’s servers after you unsubscribe from the newsletter.

**General statements on web beacons / tracking pixels**

Web beacons are invisible graphics the size of a pixel. These are used by partner companies, in particular for the purpose of tracking a user via various webpages to create a profile for use in advertising tailored to the user (targeting). A pixel integrated into the webpage is loaded from the partner’s server when the webpage is accessed. This provides the partner with your IP address, as well as information about your browser and its version, browser plug-ins used (browser fingerprint), your operating system and your network operator. For the integration of external services through web beacons / tracking pixels or other scripts, the information for advertising cookies applies accordingly.

**Content from external providers**

We use active JavaScript content and fonts on our website, which may also originate from external providers such as Google. By accessing our website, these providers may receive information about your visit to our website, for example by transmitting your IP address. You can prevent this transmission by installing a JavaScript blocker such as the browser plugin ‘NoScript’ or by deactivating JavaScript in your browser. However, this can lead to functional restrictions.

Some of our websites incorporate third-party content, such as videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps, images, texts and multimedia files, RSS feeds or other services from other websites. This always requires your IP address to be transmitted to the providers of this content. We cannot make any statement about the use of your data by these providers and also have no influence on further processing. In particular, we have no control over whether the data is used for other purposes, such as profiling. Please refer to the relevant data protection notices of the respective third-party providers. You can protect yourself against further tracking by tracking pixels from these providers by deactivating the acceptance of third-party cookies in your browser settings.

The legal basis for the transfer of personal data when integrating third-party providers is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR if the user has given their consent – e.g. by selecting this in a cookie opt-in banner – otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR i.c.w recital 47.
