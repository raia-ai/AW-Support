## Delivery reliability through networking and automation

Reflex is a genuine full-range manufacturer who produces any kind of sheet combination and any required processing, from cutting to shipping. This includes glass for interior design: If a sheet needs to have several drill holes, corner cut-outs, bevelled edges, and digital print – all this can be made.

Thanks to the networked production at their own site, Reflex always has the necessary control of quality, delivery times, and shipping – through their own fleet, of course. This applies to unique products as well as for complex glazing orders comprising hundreds of sheets. This is the basis for international business in Europe.

The production environment of Reflex is a highly integrated, networked system of modern machinery and industrial manufacturing equipment, rounded off by the sophisticated A+W production control. Only if the overall system is consistent, the individual elements can reach their peak performance.

The automated production is therefore intelligently linked with technical order entry: CNC processing centres like Forvet Chiara or the Lisec Waterjet are controlled real-time by A+W CAD Designer through high-tech interfaces like CAM-DXF. Since the latest IT modernization in 2016, the machinery of Reflex is equipped with a modern A+W factory data capture system, from cutting to shipping. This way, the processing status of every single sheet is known at any time.
