## Premium software for premium glass

The affiliated companies Klaes Jansson, Stockholm, and Martin G. Andersson of Örebro have a reputation in the industry as reliable full-range suppliers with top delivery reliability for IG, toughened glass, and processing. Klaes Jansson has been the only toughened glass producer in the Stockholm area for more than twenty years.

**Intelligent logistics**  
Complex projects require powerful logistics – from order entry via production organization to dispatch. “Today”, Stina Wollenius explains, “we profit from A+W ERP and production software which was implemented in 2009. Both production sites have a fully networked IT environment. All order data are entered just once, after which they are available throughout the company for order confirmation, control of CNC machinery, or statistical analysis.
