With high-tech insulated glass and extensive expertise in modern façade construction, FLACHGLAS SCHWEIZ is the leading supplier of building glass in the Alpine republic. For more than a year and a half, FLACHGLAS SCHWEIZ has been using A+W software.

In 2018, the company has made extensive investments: a new fully automatic laminated glass system was installed in Wikon. Furthermore, FLACHGLAS SCHWEIZ decided to expand and update its A+W software in order to further optimize processes in the office and in production.

The current A+W Production PMS system was implemented during the software update last year. FLACHGLAS SCHWEIZ is already profiting from A+W Production’s greater flexibility and many planning functions. In addition to the planning tools for work preparation, FLACHGLAS SCHWEIZ uses the A+W Production Terminals to keep employees on the insulated glass lines, in laminated glass production, and shipping informed.

In Switzerland, where both wages and prices are high, digitalization is of crucial importance. CEO Beppino Candolo explains: “Only this way can we remain competitive with companies in neighboring countries. A+W is an expert, innovative partner.”
