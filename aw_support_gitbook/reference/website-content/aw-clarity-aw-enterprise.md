## About the Product

A+W Enterprise is a state-of-the-art, high-performance ERP software solution specially developed for large and medium-sized companies in the flat glass processing industry. Our state-of-the-art software solution offers a wide range of functions to efficiently design and optimally support your business processes.

Thanks to its multi-client capability, A+W Enterprise enables the distribution of quotations and orders to different fabrication facilities, making it possible to control multiple locations from one central facility. This software solution offers fully automated handling of intra-group purchase orders between different A+W Enterprise systems and enables the mapping of centralized or decentralized company/group networks.

A key feature is the visual data entry aid, which reduces input errors and enables fast processing and order handling. By automating processes in purchasing, sales, dispatch control, and storage, fabrication time is sped up and errors are minimized. Additionally, to ensure your system is stable and secure, we built it using a UNIX/Linux system with Informix database.

### Functionalities and Benefits
