## Piloting next generation A+W ERP-Software

Thermalsun, a PPG Certified Fabricator, is located in picturesque Sonoma County, an hour’s drive north of San Francisco. Using the best available machinery and software, the state of the art facility produces the highest quality insulated glass units and tempered glass available in the Bay Area and pride themselves in the belief that a meticulous attention to detail, a drive to fabricate superior products and unequalled customer service are what set them above the standard.

The order entry via their premium A+W ERP-system, advanced equipment and high degree of automation eliminate numerous manual assembly steps- the very steps that leave competitors’ products vulnerable to order entry mistakes, fingerprints, streaks, and other imperfections.
