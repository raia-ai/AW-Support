A+W DynOpt revolutionizes the glass production process by leveraging advanced functions and state-of-the-art technologies that streamline operations. Through automatic linking and mixing of cutting orders, flexible input of residual sheets and stock glass as well as dynamic adjustment of glass types and stock sizes, A+W DynOpt ensures a seamless production process and optimum material utilization.

A notable feature of A+W DynOpt is its capability to integrate glass cutting lines using sorting systems, such as the Lisec buffer and sorting system or Hegla SortJet, with downstream stacking stations or directly connected production lines. It offers fully automated optimization, cutting, and sorting processes for maximum yield while maintaining the desired production sequences. By reducing breakage rejects and enhancing quality, A+W DynOpt, delivers unparalleled efficiency and quality.

The software solution synchronizes multiple cutting tables, enabling simultaneous cutting and breaking of diverse glass types while facilitating automatic load distribution across production lines. Its dynamic optimization algorithm reacts to sorting buffer levels, eliminating the need for extensive sorting systems and allowing for batch sizes of any scale  
A+W DynOpt’s key strengths lie in its dynamic nature, ensuring optimal material flow and balanced distribution between cutting and further processing steps.

These strengths eliminate manual steps between cutting and further processing. With enhanced automation and flexibility in planning, whether for individual or daily production, and maximum material yield through the use of a buffer, A+W DynOpt sets new benchmarks in glass production efficiency.

*   Fully automated optimization, cutting, and sorting, including recutting of broken slices
*   Automatic linking and mixing of cutting jobs for seamless production
*   Automatic & flexible input of residual plates and stock sheets
*   Dynamic and flexible modification of glass types and stock sizes
*   Controls residual stock (e.g. Hegla Remaster)

*   Controlled output into one or more harp racks, or directly to one or more IG lines
*   Synchronization of multiple cutting tables – enables cutting and breaking of multiple glass types simultaneously
*   Automatic load distribution across several production lines for optimized efficiency
*   Rush lite /orders are given higher priority for timely processing

#### Production

A+W Production is an extremely flexible PPS solution for complete rough and detailed scheduling for insulated glass, tempered glass, and laminated glass production. The system allows planning and control of even the most demanding multi-level production flows.

Project implementation was usually more complicated than we would have thought, but everything always went well in the end (…) I don’t know of any better optimization solutions.
