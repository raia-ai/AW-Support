## Automated production, manual perfection

With the expertise of traditional handicraft and software-controlled high-tech production, Löwe Fenster in Kleinwallstadt produces innovative, secure, and high-quality windows and doors. As a committed end customer supplier, this owner-operated company places special value on reliable service.

Löwe has networked all of production with the A+W Cantor Production planning and control system, a powerful database-based production solution that smooths out production thanks to its comprehensive approach.

In addition to networked control of all machines, this includes especially continuous information management at each automatic and manual workstation. Integrated materials management ensures that even during entry of an order, it is clear whether all parts required for production are in stock or whether a reorder will be necessary. This results in a smooth production flow and the greatest precision when determining the delivery date.

Ralf Klein,  
Managing Director

Production control is coupled seamlessly with the A+W Cantor Enterprise-System, the commercial-administrative part of this comprehensive information-technical ERP solution. All order data is available shortly after entry and scheduling all across the company.
