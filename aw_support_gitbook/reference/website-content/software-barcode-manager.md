#### Business

A+W Business is a complete ERP system for small and medium-sized companies. This commercial solution allows not just the entry of quotations, orders, credit notes, complaints, delivery notes, and the management of purchase orders and inquiries, but also control of other company areas (e. g. stock, purchasing, dispatch, etc.)

#### Business Pro

A+W Business Pro is a professional and cost-effective entry-level solution for small and medium-sized companies where order processing and production planning are completely integrated.

#### Production

A+W Production is an extremely flexible PPS solution for complete rough and detailed scheduling for insulated glass, tempered glass, and laminated glass production. The system allows planning and control of even the most demanding multi-level production flows.

Without a tool like the A+W software, which we also helped develop to some extent, we wouldn’t be able to run our door-panel business at all – our previous solution had simply reached its limits.

In addition to the quality of the software, the implementation and maintenance of such a system requires a strong, steady partner with experienced specialists who can react quickly and solve even difficult problems reliably. This is where our trust in A+W paid off completely. A+W software is a strong product, behind which there is a strong, innovative company. This is why we have satisfied customers and low complaint rates.
