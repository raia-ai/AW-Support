## Giving the glass value

The glass refiner and insulated glass manufacturer Glas Schöninger invests consistently in state-of-the-art software and production technology. Schöninger thus improves productivity and efficiency across the boards and expands its product range in the area of high-quality refined glass.

In order to guarantee quality and the greatest delivery reliability, for decades Glas Schöninger has relied on A+W software-controlled processes, from creating quotations to controlling production to dispatch. “Without comprehensive organization thanks to A+W software,” continues IT manager Thomas Knott, “we could never realize such short delivery times for our high-end products.”

With this quick expansion of the processing/safety glass area, an efficient solution for the production of lot size 1 had to be found.

Since the latest software reorganization, therefore, intelligent A+W interfaces between technical order entry and the CNC machines ensure the fully-automatic creation and transmission of machine codes. There is no need for time-consuming and expensive manual machine programming.

One of the most important new functions for the Glas Schöninger team is comprehensive sheet tracing via bar code reading. Thanks to systematic plant data collection (PDC), it is clear at all times which sheet is where, which processings have already been completed, and what remains to do.
