The A+W Barcode Tracking has taken our entire production organization to a new performance level. Only with it are we in a position to truly organize ourselves efficiently without long information paths, complicated inquiries, and time-consuming re-makes. Earlier, an employee frequently had to search for racks for hours in order to find a sheet if he was not sure whether or not it had been produced yet. Today, he just looks in the system – done!
