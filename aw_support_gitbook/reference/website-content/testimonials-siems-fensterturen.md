## Recognizing market opportunities – implementing innovations

Good ideas are a great thing. However, life gets really exciting when they are implemented constantly and consistently. This is the core of the recipe for success of the window builder Siems in Wiefelstede.

With the experience of three generations of owners, leading technology partners, intelligent software, and a creative team, downtime is a foreign concept at Siems. The result has been constant innovation and expansion in recent years, and also new paths for marketing.

In 2017, this window maker in the Ammerland doubled its production area from 10,000 to 20,000 square meters. In the innovation network with the machine manufacturers ROTOX and Lemuth and software partner A+W, a 220 meter-long completely automatic production line was created, one that is unique in European window production.

Machines are synchronized with transport sections and buffers, shuttles feed frames, sashes, and lites into the buffer and steer them out at the right time in the right sequence – for assembly, special construction, glazing.

The increased production capacities allowed Siems to spend more time on customer acquisition and to deliver orders on-time.
