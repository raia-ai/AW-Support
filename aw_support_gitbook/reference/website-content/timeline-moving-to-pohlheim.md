After nearly a quarter century of intensive use, the company headquarters in Linden are in urgent need of renovation. Conversions are required partially due to building law, but also ‘upgrades’, for example in the field of heat protection in summer.  
This would have required huge investment. The management therefore decides for the third move in the company’s history.  
The new company headquarters in Pohlheim are just a few kilometers away from Linden. Visitors will find modern and appealing office buildings with excellent conditions for meetings, trainings, etc.  
After extensive renovation, a friendly, light-flooded office center in the middle of the charming park-like landscape has been created that integrates workstations for intensive mental work with comfortable communication zones. The new buildings offer space for more than 150 employees.
