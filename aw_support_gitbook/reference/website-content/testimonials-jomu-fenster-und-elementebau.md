## Full-range supplier near the border to Luxembourg

Close to the border to Luxembourg, the team of JOMÜ Fenster- und Elementebau GmbH produces windows and doors made from wood, wood/aluminium, and PVC.

To complement their product range and extend their capacities, JOMÜ has bought a Biesse CNC gantry unit. Even in times when orders come thick and fast, JOMÜ can keep delivery times of 4-6 weeks. Together with the CNC unit, JOMÜ have also implemented A+W Cantor as their new business software.

Step by Step with A+W Cantor. First, the A+W Cantor ERP system and the A+W Cantor tools for production planning and control were implemented in PVC window production. PVC production went live after a brief project phase as the PVC profile master data were provided by A+W Cantor data service as a master data setup.

Wood master data were entered by JOMÜ and A+W together in the course of the project. This took a trifle longer than the master data for PVC production but Cantor does not require the input of all sorts of variants – the variant configurator can be used to define and assign rules.

After the short project phase, both production lines are successfully run by A+W Cantor Software.
