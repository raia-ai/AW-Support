# iShape - A+W Software GmbH

For the production of non-rectangular or extra-large shapes, glass processors frequently receive hand-drawn templates on paper, cardboard, wood, etc. from their customer. In order to fabricate these non-rectangular or larger shapes, modern CNC machines require digital data.

To solve this problem, A+W, in conjunction with Viprotron, developed a user-friendly, easy-to-operate app called A+W iShape.

With A+W iShape you can use your smartphone to photograph the template. The only requirement is A+W’s L-shaped reference objects that have to be placed on the template. Once photographed, the app will digitize the template by transforming the shape into an easy to edit outline, ready to be imported into A+W CAD Designer.

What makes A+W iShape special? In contrast to older solutions, there is no need to calibrate the camera! A+W iShape works with any quality smartphone camera.

1.  Place the L-shaped reference objects to automatically detect the template/photographed object.
2.  The L-shaped reference objects help correct any distortions when photographing a template.
3.  Once photographed, the iShape file can be imported into A+W CAD Designer, where further edits can be done.
4.  Transfer the DXF file to your CNC machine and start the production.

*   Quick, reliable digitalization of templates
*   Use of a good smartphone camera instead of an expensive, heavy digital camera
*   Automatic import of the photo into the A+W CAD Designer
*   Smoothing of the contour via the A+W patented smoothing process
*   Output as DXF or A+W CAD format (SN) for use in A+W ERP and control of your machines with quick transfer to CNC machines

*   Reliable compensation of distortions thanks to the reference object
*   No calibration of the camera required
*   Automatic import of the photo into the A+W CAD Designer
