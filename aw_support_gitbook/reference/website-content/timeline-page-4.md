Dr. Renate Albat and Dr. Bernd Wirsam, both physics lecturers at Giessen University, embarked on a mission to reduce flat glass waste by a minimum of 10% through cutting optimization. Their journey began when Henning Meier, a Langgöns, Germany glass processor, discussed cutting optimization challenges with Dr. Wirsam, who, despite limited expertise in the field, decided to find a solution. In April 1977, they co-founded ALBAT+WIRSAM Software GbR to realize their vision of waste reduction in the flat glass industry.

EDV in the seventies with enormous 126Kb RAM and 20Mb hard drive. This is the computer (NIXDORF 8870) used by Dr. Renate Albat and Dr. Bernd Wirsam for developing their first optimization programs and the first order processing software ALFAK for glass processors Wolff+Meier of Langgöns (Hessen).

In 1979/80, the first production planning software for the flat glass industry is launched on the market. A+W have launched the first ever order processing system for the glass industry, ALFAK. In 1980 there were already more than 100 successful installations of the glass cutting optimization TRAOPT and the order processing system ALFAK. The world-wide success of this system makes ALBAT+WIRSAM expand even further. Their business premises are moved from the office in the cellar of Wirsam’s family home to a spacious villa.

For the first time, all processes from order entry, order processing, and production control up to dispatch are networked. In 1997, A+W develops a program which makes disks, labels, and paperwork on the shop floor dispensable: ALCIM. Production was revolutionized by ALCIM in 1997 because information was available right where it was required. Order processing data are available online at the cutting lines, benders, sealing robots, and applicators. Monitors on the shop floor are a complete novelty. A+W still revolutionize production with similar systems. Needless to say that the cooperation with machinery manufacturers is as close as ever.

Schüco is the first CANTOR customer whose window production is equipped with monitors. With the production control system CANTOR CIM, the workers are provided with digital production papers right at their terminal, showing all information on the element on hand. This guarantees that the data are always up to date. Carrying stacks of papers around the shop floor is a thing of the past since the installation of 160 digital terminals at Schüco.

Wolff+Meier and A+W continue their close cooperation in the new millennium. The pilot project for controlling the dynamic glass cutting optimization by A+W’s software system DynOpt and the Hegla SortJet proves an unqualified success. Visitors from all over the world go on a pilgrimage to Langgöns (Hessen) to see the solution for themselves. With this dynamic optimization system, Wolff+Meier achieve a constant flow of glass which results in optimum yield.

After nearly a quarter century of intensive use, the company headquarters in Linden are in urgent need of renovation. Conversions are required partially due to building law, but also ‘upgrades’, for example in the field of heat protection in summer. This would have required huge investment. The management therefore decides for the third move in the company’s history. The new company headquarters in Pohlheim are just a few kilometers away from Linden. Visitors will find modern and appealing office buildings with excellent conditions for meetings, trainings, etc. After extensive renovation, a friendly, light-flooded office center in the middle of the charming park-like landscape has been created that integrates workstations for intensive mental work with comfortable communication zones. The new buildings offer space for more than 150 employees.
