# Defect Optimizer - A+W Software GmbH

Do your customers complain about faulty sheets/windows after installation? If you’re dealing with customer complaints about faulty glass or spending resources on reproducing units due to defects, then you have already incurred considerable costs in producing (and shipping) the sheet. And now you are investing again to reproduce a sheet and, if necessary, send it to the customer again.

Why not detect the defects before cutting and take them into account during optimization?  
A+W Defect Optimizer detects defects before cutting, saving you time and money. With statistically only 0.6 defects per jumbo, it identifies and corrects defects by rearranging sheets to maintain the overall sequence. In cases where defects are unavoidable, A+W Defect Optimizer offers a cost-effective solution by cutting small, low-cost sheets for defects and automatically recutting them. Defects on remaining sheets are saved, so they do not need to be detected again when used.

*   Early detection of errors in the production chain
*   Error detection, error correction, error prevention: optimization takes errors per jumbo into account, rearranges lites and attempts to maintain the overall sequence
*   If errors cannot be avoided - small (cheap) lites for errors + automatic remakes
*   Defects are saved for remaining sheets - no additional detection necessary!
*   Integration with quality scanners for accurate defect detection or based on the coordinates from your supplier

*   Real-time optimization to recalculate the existing results
*   Machine control updates during cutting process
