#### "The A+W software controls and checks all processes from entry of the order to control of the machines, on through to delivery of the finished products. Thanks to consistent barcode control and the A+W Production Monitors, we always know where each sheet is at any point in time. All commercial and technical data is available company-wide – and this without having employees running around all the time with folders and stacks of paper under their arms in order to determine what they must do with which sheet (…) All employees work productively! The focus is always on information, all the time and everywhere."

## Top products thanks to maximum automation

In Molde in the Norwegian Fjordland, a medium-sized company has become one of the state-of-the-art flat glass finishers and insulated glass producers in Norway. To achieve this status, the company relies on state-of-the-art A+W software and universal automation. Founded more than 50 years ago from a glazier’s workshop, today Rakvåg supplies the most demanding customers in Norway with highly-specialized glass products produced on state-of-the-art CNC machines.

The competition is stiff in the Norwegian flat glass industry. There are few qualified workers in this land of five million inhabitants, since many people seek employment in the ubiquitous oil industry. At the same time, quality requirements continue to increase. Consistent readiness to innovate is a prerequisite for successfully conquering this difficult market.
