# TMP Fenster + Türen - A+W Software GmbH

#### "Since the introduction of the A+W Cantor System, our production staff has taken it for granted that all parts are available exactly where they are needed."

#### Tobias Kern

##### \- TMP Fenster + Türen® GmbH

## Windows & Doors

The window and door manufacturer TMP from Bad Langensalza produces over 100,000 elements per year. And all of this is largely paperless. To implement this, TMP has been working with A+W Cantor for over twenty years. There are A+W CIM monitors at the workstations and the employees use barcode scanners. This allows information to be transmitted and made available in real time.

Due to the good order situation, TMP 2021 has opened a new logistics center with 4400 m², which will serve in the future as a central logistics warehouse for the entire TMP group of companies.

A+W had the opportunity to see all this on site last year and to conduct an interview with Managing Director Tobias Kern.

## Press Article

The German trade journal “Glaswelt” reported on the window manufacturer TMP from Bad Langensalza in its 03/23 issue, and the article also appeared in our A+W Dialog issue 11/2022.
