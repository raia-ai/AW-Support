# Realtime Optimizer - A+W Software GmbH

The A+W Realtime Optimizer revolutionizes cutting optimization in glass production by enabling flexible and extensive interventions in manufacturing processes. Even after optimization, runs can be linked, split, and reassembled.

Furthermore, optimization parameters (such as edge cut, etc.) can be changed immediately before cutting. The system distributes optimization runs online to different cutting tables, seamlessly integrates rush orders and damaged glass, while ensuring compliance with the original stacking sequences.

The intelligent utilization of leftover plates maximizes glass yield by automatically or manually identifying and linking residual plates. Additionally, the A+W Realtime Optimizer offers efficient breakage management, marking damaged panes and enabling automatic reproduction.

*   Online re-optimization of created jobs from A+W Production or A+W Business Pro (same glass type)
*   Consideration of production sequence from the production system
*   Possibility of entering rush lites / rush jobs
*   Quick-Optimization after cutting was started
*   Reduction of residue plates by using rush jobs, breakage, or sheets from following optimizations / jobs

*   Dynamic re-optimization of breakage
*   Online control of cutting tables and breakout display
*   Avoids residue plates by linking and mixing of cutting jobs
*   Improves the yield and cutting performance
*   Managing local and global breakage with re-optimization

#### Business Pro

A+W Business Pro is a professional and cost-effective entry-level solution for small and medium-sized companies where order processing and production planning are completely integrated.

#### Production

Solutions without ERP system

High-quality innovative products are just not enough to be competitive as a glass processor. Requirements such as adherence to delivery dates, flexibility and short delivery times are becoming more and more important, competing in this vein with factors such as quality and costs. Lean processes and far-reaching IT support by our A+W system, which we have been successfully working with for many years, contribute considerably to our success in a fiercely competitive market.
