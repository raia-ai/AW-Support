In 1979/80, the first production planning software for the flat glass industry is launched on the market.  
A+W have launched the first ever order processing system for the glass industry, ALFAK. In 1980 there were already more than 100 successful installations of the glass cutting optimization TRAOPT and the order processing system ALFAK.  
The world-wide success of this system makes ALBAT+WIRSAM expand even further. Their business premises are moved from the office in the cellar of Wirsam’s family home to a spacious villa.
