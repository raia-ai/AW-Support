## Automation pioneer – intelligent insulated glass production

In 2006, the first online IG-production went into operation in Germany. The medium-sized company Glas Herzog was the first to connect an automatic sorting system directly to an insulated glass line. This resolved the contradiction “glass yield versus optimal production sequence” intelligently.

Glas Herzog is known in the industry as a reliable, innovative insulated glass partner that always delivers in top quality. It is the broad spectrum of services, from expert advising to production on state-of-the-art systems to timely delivery that Glas Herzog’s customers appreciate.

Automatic line production makes manufacturing as efficient as possible at Glas Herzog. An innovation network including the software partner A+W and the machine partner HEGLA created a solution that has become the industry standard for insulated glass producers.
