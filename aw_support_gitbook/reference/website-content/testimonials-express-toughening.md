## Attractive top products - best delivery capability

Express Toughening are glass processors in the South-East of England, with a clearly defined core business: Modern toughened functional glass with all CNC processing steps required are delivered 48 hours after the order was placed – top quality and top price guaranteed.

Those short delivery times require highly efficient business and production processes which can only be controlled by state-of-the-art software systems.

Orders are entered in A+W Business and are transferred to production; the production software A+W Production sorts the orders into batches. By means of the A+W barcoding system, the sheets are guided through production.

Thanks to the intelligent A+W shape optimization system A+W Shape Optimizer, Express Toughening saves ten stockplates a day. The company combines business with pleasure: They increase their margins while reducing the CO2 emission because material-conscious glass processing protects the environment.
