## On the road to success with A+W Cantor

Over many years, the KRISPOL Company has built up an outstanding reputation with professional garage and industrial doors across Poland and beyond. KRISPOL also offers a range of first-class products in the area of windows, doors and shutters. The demanding manufacturing diversity calls for software that can handle the complete product spectrum from high-quality window construction to individually designed industrial doors. Since 2015, KRISPOL has been using A+W Cantor software at its facilities and also making it available as the Multitrade version to its trade and installation partners.

Today, with just a few mouse clicks, KRISPOL partners design not only every variety of window and door but also sectional and shutter doors with scaled drawings and correctly produced offers, orders, delivery documentation and invoices.
