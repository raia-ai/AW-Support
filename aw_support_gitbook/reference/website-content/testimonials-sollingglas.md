## Networked high-tech manufacturing – toughened safety glass for special applications

SOLLINGGLAS is a highly innovative glass processor. With the recent introduction of toughened-safety glass processing, expanded capacity in the grinding and cutting shop, and consistent A+W barcode-based controlling, the highly specialized company is now well positioned for the future. Its top quality, along with the shortest delivery times, the greatest flexibility and uncompromising customer focus, guarantee important long-term competitive advantages for Managing Director Heiko Schanze and his highly motivated team.

The owner-managed company is a leading manufacturer of a wide array of high-quality insulated-glass door panels, which are supplied to front-door producers all over Germany. Its creative designs are manufactured entirely in-house.

In close collaboration with SOLLINGGLAS, software partner A+W has integrated tools for mapping multi-layered insulated glass into its commercial solution A+W Business years ago, with a precise graphic representation of the layers and design levels.
