## From glass production to the installed conservatory

At Sinsheimer Glas and al bohn in Sinsheim they trust IT solutions from A+W.

The insulated glass units manufactured at Sinsheimer Glas are installed directly to the windows of al bohn. Sinsheimer Glas and al bohn have joined forces to become one of the strongest players in the German market. This was made possible by the fully integrated solutions provided by A+W.

A+W offer professional tools for both divisions, supporting the individual needs of their industries whilst never compromising the integrity of either. All this is done without sacrificing any of the benefits of an integrated software solution.

A+W Cantor uses the intelligent design software KKP to allow al Bohn process and produce complex conservatories within a singular platform.
