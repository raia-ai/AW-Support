## How Teutemacher Glas maximizes value creation

The company Teutemacher Glas is a medium sized state-of-the-art glass company with 80 employees. Teutemacher’s product line is broad and intelligently designed. The company sees trends early, and implements new capabilities with a sense of proportion. Teutemacher Glas integrated metal construction more than twenty years ago.

The modern toughening furnace is utilized for top-quality tempered and insulated glass, but also for difficult-to-manufacture interior solutions and showcase construction. The focus is on premium products, produced with consistent quality and minimal tolerances.

All processes from quotation and production to shipping are controlled by an integrated A+W software system.

For cutting control, Teutemacher relies on a modern sorting system that, controlled by A+W DynOpt, brings the sheets into the desired sequence at maximum yield and forwards them to the following processing machinery.

The integration of the space-saving ReMaster residual plate storage system, which is also controlled by A+W optimization software, guarantees optimum material utilisation. This solution package was subsidized by the European Fund for Regional Development because it’s so efficient.
