In the production area, utilize the app within the dispatch warehouse to efficiently book finished elements and accessories onto racks and allocate them to specific dispatch areas. Benefit from the continuous mode feature, thus allowing simultaneous scanning of multiple elements using the smartphone camera. Functioning as a mobile info terminal (read mode), the app provides valuable support by displaying production status updates for individual order items or objects located on racks. This ensures real-time tracking of element whereabouts during production. Material requisition is streamlined by scanning barcodes at predefined registration points.

Dynamic forms feature prominently in A+W Smart Companion, enabling user input via selection lists, checkboxes, sliding buttons, etc. Users have the flexibility to customize forms to suit specific requirements. Additionally, streamline complaint management by capturing complaints with accompanying photos directly within the app, thus seamlessly transmitting them to A+W Cantor CIM without redundant data entry.

Covering tasks in the stock area, including goods receipt, material transfer postings, and inventory postings, the mobile app, facilitates comprehensive refining of these processes. Easily access an overview of all counted items with data seamlessly integrated from A+W Cantor for immediate availability.
