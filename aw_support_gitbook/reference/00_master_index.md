## Search and Retrieval Guidelines

### For AI Assistant Usage

When responding to user queries, the AI assistant should:

1. **Identify the query type:**
   - Installation question → Check `01_installation/`
   - Configuration question → Check `02_configuration/`
   - How-to question → Check `03_user_manuals/`
   - Feature information → Check `04_functional_descriptions/`
   - Learning/tutorial → Check `05_training/`
   - Problem/error → Check `06_troubleshooting/` and `09_faqs/`
   - General information → Check `08_website_content/`

2. **Use metadata for filtering:**
   - Filter by `product` for product-specific queries
   - Filter by `language` for language-specific requests
   - Filter by `doc_type` for specific document types
   - Use `tags` for keyword-based retrieval

3. **Provide comprehensive answers:**
   - Reference multiple documents when appropriate
   - Include document titles and categories in responses
   - Suggest related documents for further reading
   - Cite specific sections when possible

4. **Handle multilingual queries:**
   - German queries → Prioritize documents with `language: "DE"`
   - English queries → Prioritize documents with `language: "EN"`
   - Provide translations when necessary

5. **Escalation criteria:**
   - If no relevant documents found → Suggest contacting A+W support
   - For version-specific questions → Check document version numbers
   - For critical issues → Reference troubleshooting guides first
