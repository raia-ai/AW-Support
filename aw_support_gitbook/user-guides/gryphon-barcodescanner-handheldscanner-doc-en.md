# GRYPHON™ 4500 SERIES
## Premium handheld scanners for corded or cordless value added applications using 2D barcodes

> **WIRELESS CHARGING**
> CONTACTLESS, QUICK, CAREFREE

## IMAGING TECHNOLOGY
The Gryphon 4500 series represents the premium range of handheld scanners from Datalogic for value added applications. Designed with people in mind, the Gryphon 4500 series stands out with its elegant and cutting edge design, the unchallenged ergonomics, and features the most advanced Megapixel sensor with white-illumination 2D technology for outstanding performance.

## SIMPLE TO USE AND DEPLOY
The Gryphon I 4500 omnidirectional imager provides snappy reading performance on all common 1D and 2D codes as well as postal, stacked, and composite codes like PDF417. High Density (HD) models are also available for reading smaller, condensed codes. A dedicated version with red illumination optics reads Digital Watermarking.

For mobile marketing or ticketing applications, this imager also offers excellent performance when reading bar codes from mobile devices. The enhanced optics offer improved motion tolerance and first pass decoding of fast moving codes.

## READY TO BE REGULARLY CLEANED AND DISINFECTED
Most working environments now have requirements that scanners need to be regularly cleaned and disinfected. The Gryphon 4500 series utilizes Disinfectant-Ready enclosures, designed to withstand regular daily cleaning with harsh disinfectant solutions commonly used in a healthcare environment.

## WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND WIRELESS CHARGING
Featuring Bluetooth® wireless technology (GBT models) or narrow band radio communications with Datalogic's STAR Cordless System™ (GM models), the Gryphon 4500 wireless readers provide maximum flexibility to solve any end user application with the best technical solution.

One of the most important technical innovations that the Gryphon 4500 wireless scanners achieve is the battery recharge through an inductive charging system, lowering the total cost of ownership because it eliminates the need for contacts' cleaning and maintenance procedures. The maximum reliability offered by the wireless charging technology means 24/7 activities with no stops for maintenance or repair and top-level operating productivity and performance.

## FEATURES
- 1 MP optics for superior scanning and Depth of Field
- Datalogic distinctive technology with highly visible white-illumination and 4-Dot aimer with center cross for targeted scanning
