The first section explains how to define a fixed price for an entire order, a single item, or a group of items, including applying discounts. The second major section introduces macros, explaining how to create, save, use, and manage them to streamline the input of frequently occurring product structures and prices. This includes customer-specific and general macros. The final section covers the use of SN Files and Templates for managing product shapes.
