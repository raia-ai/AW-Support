# BQR Changes 2025 FAQ

Change in BQR Bonus

TL;DR:
The “Performance Factor Target” is being discontinued and replaced by the “Personal
Factor,” simplifying the bonus calculation without affecting the payout, effective from
2025.


Q: What is being changed?
A: The “Performance Factor Target” will be discontinued. The previous “Personal Target
Bonus in %” will be converted into the “Personal Factor.”

Q: Why is the change being made?
A:
   • The BQR Bonus considers EBITA (profit) and NRG (growth) in the “Performance
      Factor Target.”
   • These metrics have not been adjusted in the bonus matrix in recent years to
      avoid a negative effect on the bonus.
   • The EBITA target is still at 28% and the growth target (NRG) at 7%, although the
      current CSI targets are at 30% and 10%.
   •   The difference between the previous values and the current CSI targets is now
       too large.
   •   With the previous bonus model, there would have been a need to adjust the
       targets, which would have had a negative impact on the individual employee's
       bonus due to higher targets.
   •   Therefore, it was decided to exclude these two metrics (EBITA and NRG target)
       from the calculation to avoid target adjustments every couple of years.

New:




If we would have changed the targets to 30% EBITA and 10%, this is how it would have
impacted your bonus:

Old target as previously:
New target with higher EBITA & NRG:




You can see that this change would have decreased your bonus in this exemplary
scenario by -982€ (5.542€-4.560€)


Q: How is the new “Personal Factor” calculated?
A: As the fixed variable “Performance Factor Target” is removed, the new "Personal
Factor" is calculated as follows:

Personal Target Bonus in %
_____________________________= NEW Personal Factor
OLD Performance Factor Target



If your Personal Target Bonus is for example 8% and given the old Performance Factor
Target of 23,04% (see screenshot above), this is the calculation:

0,08
______ = 0,347222222…

0,2304

Simplified, this means that "Personal Target Bonus in %" x 4,34027777777778 =
"NEW Personal Factor"

Here is a chart of the conversion:

 Personal Target         Personal Factor
 (old)                   (new)
                    5%          0,217013889

Important reminder: If you were affected by the conversion of the employee bonus in
2023, your Personal Target displayed on your bonus matrix might be a rounded value.


Q: Does the change affect the payout amount I receive?
A: No, the old target values (28% EBITA / 7% NRG) will continue to serve as the basis.
The final result remains identical, regardless of whether the traditional or the new
method is applied.

New:




Q: When will the change take effect?
A: The new model will be implemented from 2025. The matrices for 2024 (payout in
April 2025) will still be calculated using the traditional method.


Q: Why is the new “Personal Factor” not given as a percentage?
A: The value is now presented as a number to align with the common practice of CSI.


Q: Why is the “Personal Target Bonus in local currency” being discontinued?
A: This value was previously based on the annual salary and the “Personal Target Bonus
in %.” With the new Performance Factor, this calculation is no longer possible.
However, the entire bonus will still be represented based on the expected EBITA and
NRG values of the respective business unit.
