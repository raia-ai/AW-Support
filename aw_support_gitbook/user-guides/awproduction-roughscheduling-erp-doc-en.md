| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**       | Each training module starts with an overview of the major topics: Objectives: What shall be conveyed? Benefit: What can this knowledge be used for? Maxims: Which correlations are to be remembered? |
| **Concepts**       | First, the concepts and terms of the corresponding training module will be explained. This is followed by examples and instructions.     |
| **Exercises**      | There are exercises featuring special tasks for some of the training sessions.                                                           |
