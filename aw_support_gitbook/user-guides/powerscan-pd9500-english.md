POWERSCAN™ PD9500


AIM, TRIGGER, DECODE: IT’S THAT
SIMPLE!
An intuitive and effortless scanning
experience is the target of the
PowerScan™ 9500 family. It combines
omnidirectional reading capabilities,
which is typical in all area imaging
scanners, with outstanding optical
characteristics. The result is a scanner
that is able to read any kind of bar code,
regardless of the orientation, from
contact to over 1.0 m / 3.3 ft, depending
on the bar code resolution. In addition,
the PowerScan PD9500 area imager
includes Datalogic’s latest decoding
software that guarantees snappy
reading in any type of environment. Aim,
trigger, decode: it is that simple!
DEVELOPED WITH THE USER IN MIND
User comfort is guaranteed because of
the scanner ergonomics, consisting of
the handle shape, a well-balanced weight
and an intuitive aiming system, allowing
the highest first-pass reading rate while
reducing unnatural wrist movement or
rotation which can tire any user during
long shifts. Additionally, the PowerScan
9500 area imager uses a soft-pulsed
white illumination light resulting in        FEATURES                                         INDUSTRY-APPLICATIONS
