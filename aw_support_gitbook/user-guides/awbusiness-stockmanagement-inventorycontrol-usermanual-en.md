short_description: "This document is a tutorial on the Stock and Master Data modules within the A+W Business software. It covers the setup and management of stock levels, storage locations, stock categories, product definitions, and pricing."
long_description: "This comprehensive tutorial provides detailed instructions for managing stock and related master data within the A+W Business enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The document is divided into several key sections, starting with the foundational concepts of stock management, including defining stock levels (e.g., warehouse, corridor, shelf, tray), storage locations, and stock categories to facilitate better analysis and organization. It then moves into configuring company-wide data, such as stock control modes for reservations and parameters for purchase price calculations. A significant portion of the document is dedicated to Product Definition, explaining the distinction between products, stock articles, and stock sizes (fixed dimensions). It details how to set up procurement types (e.g., cutting, stock withdrawal, production), stock booking types (size-related vs. not size-related), and how to manage stock control at the Bill of Materials (BOM) level. The tutorial also covers pricing, including the calculation of average purchase prices and how to configure price lists. The final sections focus on the practical application of these settings through Stock Management, covering the creation of stock articles, handling stock movements (additions, dispatches, transfers), using queries to analyze stock data, and generating automatic stock purchase orders (P.O.s) when inventory falls below minimum levels. The guide includes numerous screenshots of the software's user interface, step-by-step instructions, and exercises to reinforce the concepts."

# Master Data: Stock Definition

Set the following settings to display your stock:
- Names of stock levels
- Stock levels
- Storage locations

You can adjust the names of the different levels to the requirements in your company. You should also use this option if you only work with one level.

### Storage location
You can specify up to four differentiation level to define storage places to differentiate for example between warehouses, aisles, shelves and trays. The storage locations are used for stock management and for the inventory.
