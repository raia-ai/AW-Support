                                 Documentation
                                 The tutorial on A+W Capa View explains how you work with the visualization
                                 of the product capacities.

                                 Subjects
                                 This tutorial offers the following subjects:
                                 •    A+W Capa View
                                 •    Displaying data
                                 •    Operate program

                                 Required knowledge
                                 This tutorial is aimed at employees who require an overview of the current pro-
                                 duction, e.g. sales staff and employees entering orders. The prerequisite is
                                 knowledge of how to use a touchscreen. This specifically includes the follow-
                                 ing gestures: clicking, swiping, zooming in and zooming out. You can also use
                                 a mouse to operate this program.

                                 Reading tip
                                 The contents of a training module are based on the knowledge conveyed in
                                 the previous module. We therefore recommend you do not skip any modules.

                                 Display Conventions
                                 Certain parts of sentences are specially marked. The meanings are:

                                 Italics                    are marked character strings that describe the elements
                                                            of the software, e. g. the Settings selection.

                                 Bold                       are marked sequences of symbols that you key in with
                                                            the keyboard such as the number 0.

                                 >                          So-called "breadcrumb trails" mark the way in which you
                                                            open a view, e. g. Documents > Order > Order > Func-
                                                            tions > Capacity Overview.

                                 []                         Square brackets designate buttons in the dialog. For
                                                            instance, you use [settings] to define the language.

                                 <>                         Angled brackets designate buttons or combinations of
                                                            buttons on your keyboard, such as updating your

                                          A+W Capa View
                                          A+W Capa View is a service with a web-based interface to display data from
                                          A+W Production.
                                          A+W Capa View can be launched in the latest version of any browser. The ad-
                                          dress to the requested server can be saved as a favorite or link on the desktop
                                          – like all Internet addresses. In addition, you can open A+W Capa View direct-
                                          ly in A+W Business (Document entry > Functions > Capacity overview). For
                                          A+W Dashboard, a new view type has been implemented in which you can in-
                                          clude and display the views of A+W Capa View.

                                          The idea behind the program
                                          A+W Capa View is a tool used to visualize the available capacities in Produc-
                                          tion and the production progress. It shows the shifts that have been created in
                                          A+W Capacity Planning. The number of unscheduled and scheduled capaci-
                                          ties and the number of produced orders are shown within these shifts. You are
                                          also able to have the order and batch-related production progress displayed
                                          and are thus able to always provide your customers with up-to-date informa-
                                          tion about the orders.

                                        A+W Capacity Planning and the barcoding data are used for the display. Ac-
                                        cordingly, A+W Capa View provides sales staff, for example, with a view of the
                                        current capacities in Production. Thus, sales staff directly on site at the cus-
                                        tomer can make a statement as to whether a large project, e.g. a construction
                                        project, can still be scheduled for a certain week.
                                        Employees in Order Entry can set up links with preset views of bottleneck ma-
                                        chines and can thus obtain a quick overview of production capacities. In addi-
                                        tion, they can view order and batch-related production progress by double-
                                        clicking a shift.

                                            Correct display only if barcoding bookings are correct
                                            An up-to-date A+W Capacity Planning and complete barcoding bookings
                                            are required for informative displays.

                                 View bottleneck machines
                                 A+W Capa View shows all machines that have been defined in A+W Capacity
                                 Planning.
                                 View the bottleneck machines to decide whether an order can still be produced
                                 in a certain week or not.

                                 Features
                                 A+W Capa View shows the capacities of the machines and thus provides a
                                 high level of transparency.
                                 A+W Capa View shows the order and batch-related production progress. Ac-
                                 cordingly, you can always provide your customers with up-to-date information
                                 about orders.
                                 In realtime, you receive information about individual machines, e.g. cutting, IG
                                 lines, processing, and TG production: You will see the unscheduled and
                                 scheduled capacities and already produced orders.
                                 This program can be used both on large monitors in various production depart-
                                 ments and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. However, this re-
                                 quires an internet browser and access to this program (address and user

                                           In the top section of the Detailed View, three bars are displayed for the select-
                                           ed shift.

                                           •   Scheduled, unscheduled and produced pieces of the shift; unit: pieces.
                                           The bars are always displayed over the entire width of the window, which cor-
                                           responds to the entire time, area or pieces of the corresponding shift.

                                           Select for the bottom section of the Detailed View whether the data should be
                                           shown batch or order-related. You can choose the criteria for displaying the
                                           data:
                                           •   Time in hours

                                           •   Quantity in square meters
                                           The employee can see how much has been produced already from the corre-
                                           sponding orders. During a shift, the gray bars, i.e. scheduled capacities, turn
                                           into green bars, i.e. already produced capacities.

                                               Correct display only if barcoding bookings are correct
                                               You need complete barcoding bookings for a meaningful Detailed View.

                                   You can open A+W Capa View with different devices and from different appli-
                                   cations. You can copy the URL of a view in the Settings dialog. The current
                                   settings are transferred together with a copied URL. This would provide you
                                   with, for example, the same color scheme, the same machine or the same time
                                   period – on all devices.

                                   URLs as favorites and shortcuts
                                   Copy the URL with the current settings and save it in the browser as a favorite,
                                   or create a shortcut on the desktop. This way, you can have preset data dis-
                                   played for certain machines, machine groups or shifts.
