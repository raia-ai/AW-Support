long_description: "This document is a software reference guide for the 'A+W Enterprise Preise und Konditionen' module. It provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and managing various pricing components. The guide is structured into several key areas: 'Sprossenpreise (Glazing Bar Prices)' details how to define price classes (Sprossenpreisklassen) and assign them to specific glazing bar articles, explaining different calculation methods for sales (VK) and purchase (EK) prices. 'Zuschläge (Surcharges)' covers the configuration of various surcharges, including 'Modellzuschläge' (for non-rectangular shapes), 'Größenzuschläge' (for small, oversized, or long items), 'Dickenzuschlagsvektoren' (surcharges based on glass thickness), and 'Bearbeitungsgruppenzuschläge' (for specific processing steps), also explaining surcharge matrices for tiered pricing. 'Preissteuerung (Price Control)' describes how to set up global pricing rules, such as inter-company price calculations, ESG model discounts, contribution margin alerts, and the handling of price list validity periods (PLKZ logic). 'Konditionen (Conditions)' explains the hierarchy of conditions, from general daily conditions ('Tageskonditionen') to specific conditions for market partners, objects, product groups, or individual articles ('Spezielle Konditionen'), detailing the application of factors, discounts (Rabatte), and surcharges. The document includes user interface screenshots, field descriptions, technical database information, and practical examples to guide administrators and power users in maintaining pricing master data in the A+W Enterprise system."
