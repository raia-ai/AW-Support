# Tutorial 2 Additional Information

## Monitoring of changes

Changes in customer-, supplier-, price-, and discount management can be monitored. The individual dialogs offer the menu **History** for this purpose.

For all database tables accessed by a dialog you can define how changes shall be monitored. Detailed monitoring is possible if the tables in question are monitored on field level.

Monitoring of changes is set and enabled for every dialog separately. Generally, analysis shows the changes for the selected record. Apart from that, analysis can be based on number manager, or on all records.

Settings and analysis always refer to the currently set runtime mode. In price management for example, this applies to the analysis of changes of standard prices, customer prices, customer group prices, etc.

Apart from that, analysis can be restricted by various filters, e.g. to a certain user or period.
