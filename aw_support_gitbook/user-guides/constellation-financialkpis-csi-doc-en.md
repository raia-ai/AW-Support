## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The presentation mentions several key KPIs used inside the Constellation Software group (including all subsidiaries' financial reporting) that are important for measuring business performance. Here are the main KPIs discussed:

1.  **EBITA**: Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. It represents the total operating profit remaining after subtracting operating costs from Net Revenue. EBITA % is calculated as EBITA divided by Net Revenue.
2.  **Revenue Growth**: This includes Organic Revenue Growth (ORG or OG), which is the year-over-year growth in Net Revenue excluding acquired revenue, and Net Revenue Growth (NRG), which includes acquired revenue.
3.  **Business Quality Ratio (BQR)**: A combined metric of profitability and growth, calculated as EBITA % plus Organic Growth %. It helps identify high-quality and poor-performing businesses.
4.  **Departmental Ratios**: These include various ratios for different departments such as Sales and Marketing Ratio, Maintenance Ratio, Professional Services Ratio, Research and Development Ratio, and General and Administrative Ratio.

These KPIs are essential for tracking progress towards business goals and comparing performance across different business units.

### Other Key Metrics
- **Gross Revenue**: This is the total revenue generated by the business before deducting any costs. It includes all sources of income such as sales, services, and other revenue streams.
- **Net Revenue**: This is the revenue remaining after deducting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Gross Revenue. It represents the actual income generated by the business.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: These are the direct costs associated with producing goods or services sold by the business. It includes expenses such as materials, labor, and overhead.
- **Operating Expenses (OPEX)**: These are the expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations of the business. They include costs such as salaries, rent, utilities, and marketing.

## Core Financial Metrics

### EBITA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization)
EBITA represents the total operating profit that remains after subtracting the operating costs of the business unit from Net Revenue. The formula for EBITA is:
$$
\text{EBITA} = \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses (OPEX)}
$$
EBITA % is calculated as:
$$
\text{EBITA %} = \frac{\text{EBITA}}{\text{Net Revenue}}
$$
EBITA is important because it allows you to compare the business results of different businesses that may have different financing and tax structures, as well as business units of different sizes. It is a building block to many CSI ratios, such as the Business Quality Ratio (BQR) and Core Profit Ratio (CPR).

### Core Profit Ratio (CPR)
The Core Profit Ratio (CPR) is a measure of the profitability of the core business. It is calculated as EBITA divided by Net Maintenance Revenue (NMR). The formula for CPR is:
$$
\text{CPR} = \frac{\text{EBITA}}{\text{Net Maintenance Revenue}}
$$
This ratio helps to understand how profitable the core business is by focusing on the recurring revenue streams, such as maintenance and support, and excluding one-time or non-recurring revenues.

### Business Quality Ratio (BQR)
The Business Quality Ratio (BQR) is a combined metric of profitability and growth that CSI has developed. It is calculated as the sum of EBITA % and Organic Growth %. The formula for BQR is:
$$
\text{BQR} = \text{EBITA %} + \text{Organic Growth %}
$$
The BQR is important for several reasons:
- **Simplicity**: It cuts down to a single ratio to identify high-quality and poor-performing businesses, making it easy for anyone to understand.
- **Illustrates Trade-offs**: It shows the natural trade-off that all business units face between profitability and growth.
- **Benchmarking**: It allows for business unit comparison regardless of size, providing a clear benchmark.

This ratio helps in identifying businesses that are performing well in terms of both profitability and growth, making it a valuable tool for business analysis.

#### High BQR Examples
These businesses are considered high-quality because they have strong profitability and growth metrics.
- **Business A**: EBITA % of 25% and an Organic Growth % of 10%, resulting in a BQR of 35%.
- **Business B**: EBITA % of 30% and an Organic Growth % of 15%, resulting in a BQR of 45%.
- **Business C**: EBITA % of 20% and an Organic Growth % of 5%, resulting in a BQR of 25%.

#### Low BQR Examples
These businesses are considered low-quality because they have weak profitability and growth metrics.
- **Business D**: EBITA % of 5% and an Organic Growth % of -2%, resulting in a BQR of 3%.
- **Business E**: EBITA % of 8% and an Organic Growth % of 0%, resulting in a BQR of 8%.
- **Business F**: EBITA % of 10% and an Organic Growth % of -5%, resulting in a BQR of 5%.

## Departmental Ratios

### Professional Services Ratio (PS Ratio)
This ratio measures the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the professional services team in generating revenue. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{PS Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Professional Services Revenue}}{\text{Professional Services Costs}}
$$
To understand this ratio, it's important to consider the main drivers:
1.  **Pricing**: The rates charged for professional services.
2.  **Productivity**: The efficiency and effectiveness of the professional services team in delivering services.
3.  **Cost**: The expenses incurred in providing professional services, including salaries, benefits, and other related costs.

A higher PS Ratio indicates that the professional services team is generating more revenue relative to their costs, which is a sign of efficiency and profitability. A good PS Ratio is typically considered to be **greater than 2**.

**Example:** If a business has net professional services revenue of $200,000 and professional services costs of $100,000, the PS Ratio would be:
$$
\text{PS Ratio} = \frac{\$200,000}{\$100,000} = 2
$$

### Sales and Marketing Ratio (S&M Ratio)
This ratio measures how efficiently and cost-effectively the sales and marketing team is bringing in new business. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{S&M Ratio} = \frac{70\% \text{ of Net License & Hardware Revenue}}{\text{Sales & Marketing Costs}}
$$
This ratio is important because new license revenue is a precursor for future maintenance revenue. A higher S&M Ratio indicates that the sales and marketing team is generating more revenue relative to their costs, which is a sign of efficiency and profitability.

### Maintenance Ratio
The Maintenance Ratio (or Customer Support ratio) measures the profitability of maintenance revenue streams. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{Maintenance Ratio} = \frac{85\% \text{ of Net Maintenance/Warranty Revenue}}{\text{Maintenance Costs}}
$$
Maintenance revenue is considered the most profitable revenue stream for the business. The primary revenue risk associated with maintenance is customer attrition. Recurring maintenance leads to stable revenue streams. Best practices to optimize the Maintenance Ratio include increasing prices annually (by at least CPI) and never discounting maintenance.

### Research and Development Ratio (R&D Ratio)
The R&D Ratio is a key metric used to measure the cost recovery of R&D investments. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{R&D Ratio} = \frac{(30\% \text{ of Net License & Hardware Revenue}) + (15\% \text{ of Net Maintenance Revenue})}{\text{R&D Costs}}
$$
This ratio measures R&D as an ongoing investment versus solely as a cost. It looks at R&D in a cost recovery manner. A ratio less than 1 indicates that the business is losing money in R&D and not recovering its costs.

### General and Administrative Ratio (G&A Ratio)
The G&A Ratio is a key metric used to measure the efficiency of general and administrative expenses. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{G&A Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total General & Admin Costs}}{\text{Total Net Revenue}}
$$
This ratio helps to understand how much of the total net revenue is being spent on general and administrative costs. A good G&A Ratio is typically considered to be **less than 15%**. A lower G&A Ratio indicates that the business is managing its administrative expenses efficiently relative to its revenue.
