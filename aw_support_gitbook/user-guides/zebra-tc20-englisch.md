The TC20 puts all the features you need to
save time and money, increase sales and boost
                   profitability in your store,
                     right in the palm of your hand.
                     Built for work
                     Drop it on the floor. Spill water on it. Use it in a dusty backroom, out in the rain,
                     extreme heat or below freezing temperatures. The TC20 can handle it all.

                     All day power — always
                     Running low on power? No problem. No need to find a charger — just snap on
                     the unique PowerPack and keep on working.

                     A real scanner for real time-savings
                     Smartphone cameras aren’t built for barcode scanning — that’s why the TC20 delivers
                     the same scanning technology that most of the world’s retailers rely on every day. You
                     get instant and effortless point-and-shoot capture of any electronic or printed barcode in
                     any condition — just like taking a photo. And if you have a task that requires the capture
                     of a lot of barcodes, do it comfortably with the snap-on snap-off trigger handle.

                     Instantly document everything
                     Document anything with the 8 MP autofocus color camera — from damage to a
                     return to a copy of a driver’s license for a credit card application.

                     When it comes to service and support, we’ve got you covered
                     Get the right level of support for the right price with Zebra OneCare™ SV. You get
                     two years of coverage for normal wear and tear and device failure, unmatched
                     from-the-manufacturer technical support, a Device Diagnostics Tool for onsite
                     troubleshooting, priority repair turnaround time, free return shipping, and more.
                     All for a fraction of the cost of a single, uncovered repair.

                     Easy to use — no learning curve
                     The TC20 brings the smartphone simplicity you want in a business tool — from Android
                     to the bright screen that is easy to see indoors and outside, to the large display and three
                     programmable buttons to instantly access your most used features and applications.

                     Doubles as a walkie-talkie
                     Get the power of an instant voice connection — at no cost. With the press of a button,
                     you can reach a specific worker, a specific group of workers, or all of your workers.*

                     The fastest wireless connections
                     All wireless radios are not created equally. WIth the TC20, you not only get the
                     fastest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, you get wireless connections that are as
                     dependably solid and fast as wired connections.

                     Charge it your way
                     The TC20 charging cradle couldn’t be more versatile. Charge the all-touch or keyboard
                     models with or without the PowerPack. Charge the all-touch model with or without the
                     trigger handle. Or charge the PowerPack alone — all with one cradle. And the 5-slot
                     universal ShareCradle enables the efficient, cost-effective use of space in the backroom.

                     Entering barcodes into your apps couldn’t be easier
                     Send barcodes captured with the scanner right into your existing apps with Zebra’s
                     DataWedge — no programming or modification of your existing apps required. The
                     result? A big time-savings — without any cost.

                     SMALL BUSINESS. For 45 years, Zebra has made innovative
