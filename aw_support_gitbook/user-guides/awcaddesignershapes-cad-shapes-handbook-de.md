long_description: "This document is a comprehensive tutorial for the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software, written in German. It is part of a larger manual focusing on advanced features like creating complex shapes, edge cutouts, drill holes, and inner contours. The tutorial is structured as a series of numbered exercises ('Übungen'), each building on the previous one. It starts with basic shape manipulation like rotating and mirroring, then moves to more complex tasks such as creating shapes with rounded corners, keyholes, and multiple arcs. The guide provides step-by-step instructions, complete with technical drawings, dimensions, and illustrations of the required software tools. A significant portion of the tutorial is dedicated to creating and using 'Ausschnittmakros' (cutout macros) and 'Templates' for A+W Business integration. This section explains how to group objects, define reference points, and prepare drawings for automated production workflows, thereby saving time and ensuring consistency in daily operations."
