short_description: "This document outlines the unique selling propositions (USPs) of A+W Smart Factory and A+W DynOpt (Dynamic Optimization) for flat-glass manufacturing. It contrasts traditional push-based, batch-centric production with A+W’s pull-based, real-time shopfloor control driven by software agents/digital twins. The approach automates late changes, optimizes buffers and racks, and improves yield while reducing manual interventions. It also explains the industry context around brittle material, breakage, residuals, and batching constraints, and summarizes observed differences versus alternative solutions from vendors such as Lisec, Fenetech, Hegla-Hanic, Optima, Synerglass, and Chinese “blackbox” sorting systems."
long_description: "This document presents a structured view of the USPs of A+W Smart Factory and A+W DynOpt (Dynamic Optimization) within the flat-glass industry. It frames the central paradigm shift from push-based, batch-oriented production—still common even when planning is done Just-In-Time—to a true pull-based mode of shopfloor control. In push mode, production quantities are prepared upstream (e.g., at cutting) and pushed through subsequent processes, with late changes typically handled manually. By contrast, the A+W approach orchestrates production in real time using a system of software agents or digital twins that communicate process needs and current states across the line. What starts next is decided by the holistic, moment-to-moment situation; short-term changes such as delivery updates are incorporated automatically.

The document explains why this matters in glass production: lot sizes are small, product mix varies continuously, and glass is brittle, with breakage at cutting and additional losses through heat treatment. Traditional batching creates rigidity, extra handling for exceptions, and residual plates that can degrade yield if not effectively reused. While many systems digitize paperwork via terminals and data collection, they still rely on batches and push execution. A+W’s pull-mode concept removes much of that rigidity, enabling dynamic optimization of buffers, improved yield by exploiting available buffer slots, and significant reductions in manual planner effort—illustrated, for example, by the A+W Rack Optimizer’s automation compared with more manual rack allocation approaches.

A practical perspective is provided through observations from operations such as Pressglass: areas like buffer loading and table distribution are frequently still manually supervised in some competitor setups, whereas A+W automates these functions. The document compares A+W’s capabilities with alternatives from Lisec (Autofab, GPS-Rack), Fenetech/Fenevision, Hegla-Hanic, Optima, Synerglass, and Chinese equipment manufacturers that often implement a “blackbox” push approach with limited ability to resequence or respond to real-time changes. European sorting systems combined with A+W automation support true pull operation, dynamic re-sorting, and real-time re-optimization, aligning production with actual demand.

Overall, the content highlights that moving from pushing to pulling is not incremental but a paradigm change that requires substantial software re-engineering. A+W Smart Factory is designed around this pulling paradigm, with parts of the approach protected by patents, making short-term imitation difficult and underpinning the USPs described throughout the document."

## A+W DynOpt and/or Smart Factory automation USPs


## General thoughts and facts about USPs:

It is all about “Pushing-” and “Pulling-” Mode through the shopfloor in production.
State of the art planning mode is JUST-IN-TIME (Just-In-Time). All shopfloor systems offer at least basic features in this respect. Once actual production is started, however, the current state of the art is “Pushing-Mode”:
Work quantities are gathered according to JUST-IN-TIME planning for the initial stage of production, typically cutting, and then after optimization are directed to production and subsequent processes considering the real-time status of later production stages.
Any change in planning happening after the release to production according to short-term changes require today in all glass processing niche MES and ERP systems manual actions by human beings.
The A+W automation systems (A+W Smart Factory and A+W DynOpt, where Dynopt stands for “Dynamic Optimization”) are, currently, the one and only system in the flat-glass-industry offering “Pulling-Mode” shopfloor control (and at least a part of this approach being protected by international patents):
Quantities of work are collected based on the requirements of the respective process to follow based on its current needs. To achieve this, a system of software agents or digital twins communicates the current needs of process areas in real time. Hence, what starts next is based on the current situation within the whole system! Short-term changes, for example concerning delivery, are incorporated automatically by the system.
A complete change from “Pushing-” to “Pulling-” Mode requires re-engineering of larger parts of the software portfolio. It is not a gradual change but a change in the paradigm! Hence, competition will not catch up easily or short-term.


## Some thoughts about the shop floor organization in flat glass industry:

To reach a better understanding of the consequences of the change in the paradigm between pushing and pulling, a deeper understanding of the typical organization of production is helpful. The main underlying problem in this industry is the need for a variant type of production having very limited added value. Lot sizes are very small (less than 10, typically) and lead time is quite short, in addition. Hence, quantities to be produced are known very lately and product mix varies continuously.
IT, typically, evolves based on automation of former human actions. Hence, IT systems followed the habit of collecting customer orders on shelves sorted by production shift and production batches derived from those. Batches resulted in paperwork being distributed in the factory to follow the flow.
Main drawback of this organization is lack of flexibility! Any type of late change requires specific action resulting not rarely in specific workers dedicated to following exceptions.
Glass, however, is a brittle material. 0.5 % of production gets already broken in cutting. Once heat treatment is in place, this adds another 5 % (!). Comparing this, we have to keep in mind that the average profit of such companies lies in the area of 5-10 %.
So, a production area, where 5 % material loss is standard requires specific action and handling. It absolutely is in the natural interest of the producer to reduce the loss or waste here.
In addition, batching results in residual plates per glass-type per batch. A validated figure for typical glass production is a value of about 10 % in overall yield loss if all residuals are discarded. Well organized manual organizations achieve a re-use of 5 % of residuals.
Keeping all this in mind, the question is how to get out of these dilemmas. The most valid influencing factor is the grouping of production into batches which is absolutely necessary in a manual, human-based organization. To get out of these restrictions, a reliable IT system is mandatory. Typical state-of-the-art systems, today, try to ease the situation by replacing paperwork with terminals and shopfloor data collection having a special view on the exceptions named above. Still, those systems relay on grouping the production work into batches and pushing them through the various production steps.
In an ideal world, grouping of products is required at the end of production only. At that point, clearly, groups of products will be shipped to customers. Giving up grouping within products, however, will result in humans having no orientation any more on individual products without the aid of the IT system. In addition, changing an IT system from the paradigm of pushing into the paradigm of pulling requires a larger part of re-engineering. For example, the batch number is a key identifier within the database of an IT system in pushing-mode. It more or less does not exist or has no relevant meaning in an IT system in pulling-mode. The A+W Smart Factory system is designed around the paradigm of pulling-mode! There is no incremental change from an old-fashioned system to a system that is based on the pulling-mode!
Organizing a factory based on A+W Smart Factory, therefore, eases most of the dilemmas described above. At any stage of production, the system is capable of organizing the next production step (grouping and optimizing units) based on the actual knowledge of the situation within the factory and its delivery requirements. Hence, any kind of exception, like breakages or last-minute changes in delivery, are coped with having the relatively best solution possible at that moment. Therefore, residuals are kept to a minimum and remakes due to breakages or other malfunctions are simply part of normal production without adding additional requirements like dedicated workers.
Clearly, this is a big change in shop-floor organization. Hence, workers and management have to be convinced that this change is valuable for them and that the new IT is reliable and robust. Dependency on IT is on a much higher level!

A**n example: Insulating glass production with cutting, sorting using a buffer and IGU lines:**
A classic organization like the one typically used by LISEC automation systems would work as follows: Work is grouped into larger batches, say about 100 IGU units per batch. Assume, we have a few batches like this to do each one having 3 delivery racks holding 30 – 40 units. Those batches are assumed to have a preferred sequence. 
Operators at cutting, then, being responsible to provide a batch as quickly and completely as possible at best possible yield, will select the next batch from the list and start it. Likely, LISEC’s “dynamic optimization” will do this for them starting the next respective batch automatically once the former one is finished.
The batch is, then, cut and stored in the buffer (which needs to be able to hold at least a lot more than one batch). Some parts of the forthcoming batch are used to fill residual plates, but care has to be taken (manually) to not overload the buffer doing so.
IGU operator is responsible to select the next batch to be done on his line. He will have to wait until the corresponding batch is completely loaded into the buffer as there is no bias in cutting as to cut the most urgent sheets first. Consequently, the first sheet out could be the last sheet in. The racks assigned to this batch are, then, loaded from the line.
Any change in sequence is a nightmare in this organization! The next batch is, typically, not completely in the buffer, so no choice to take it first (as the first sheets needed will, likely, not be in the buffer yet). Even changing the sequence of the individual rack contained in the batch is hardly impossible. The reason for this being the fact that loading the buffer is based on batches and their respective unloading sequence. Hence, glass needed for racks being later in sequence will, very likely, be stored behind glass required for the current rack.
Given the situation that everything is working as planned, however, this organization is easy to understand for operators and there are clear responsibilities. In case of exceptions, everything relies on the workers. A worker making it work in this case may himself feel as a hero. This should not be underestimated!

Now how would this work in an A+W Smart Factory way?
We still are having a few 100 IGU units to do having a preferred sequence. As shopfloor control is continuous based on individual sheets and units and there, corresponding, sequence in time (the timeline), there is no need in grouping several delivery racks into batches. Hence, formally, every rack would be considered as an individual batch! (In a classic system, this would result in a disaster with respect to yield, as optimization is batch by batch with some limited overlap).
There is only one operator in charge for the whole production. He arranges the individual racks in preferred sequence and monitors completion of those racks through the processes.
Based on the sequence of racks, the system derives a corresponding timeline used as a priority schema in cutting. Hence, the most urgently needed sheets are always having the highest priority. Optimization for cutting is in a mix of those priorities balancing those automatically against buffer usage. Hence, sheets needed later are considered to improve yield as far as possible avoiding deadlock situations (a deadlock would be e.g. the first sheet needed at the buffer exit for e.g. the IG-line, cannot go into the buffer as it is already full). Any change in preferred sequence of the racks foreseen at the end of the IGU line has immediate effect regarding those priorities. The same holds for breakages which are incorporated automatically into the flow.
Responsibility of the worker at cutting is just cutting!
Similarly, responsibility of the worker at IGU assembly is simply “keep the line running”.
The operator in charge, continuously, as far as possible, monitors the situation. Typically, the sheets for the units needed for the first racks in sequence are in the buffer and more or less sheets for consecutive racks are in the buffer as well. At any time, the operator is able to see how much additional time will be needed to complete a rack not already being completely in the buffer. He, as well, is able to see how much consecutive operation can be performed on the IGU line before it will stop due to lack of a sheet in the buffer (using A+W’s feature: Estimated time of operation based on shopfloor data collection averages).
Based on this knowledge, he may decide to push a different delivery rack into the position in time after the one currently in operation. He may, as well, stop the operation for the current rack, run a different rack and continue, after completion, with the original rack.
Any change in sequence of those delivery racks will have immediate effect on priorities!
Example: A very urgent rack containing just a few IGU units is placed just behind the current rack or one rack later in sequence. Sheets corresponding to this rack will have maximal priority in cutting instantly. Hence, there is a good chance they will be in the buffer once the rack previously attached is finished. If not, the operator may move this urgent rack just one more backwards to avoid a standstill. Adding this “emergency” rack into the production sequence is, therefore, almost free of extra costs! This is a big contrast to the classic organization!
Workers at cutting and at the IGU line will, however, have completely different responsibilities. A proper training is required, and workers need to be convinced regarding the advantages of this operation as it contrasts with what they were used to do!
In addition, the operator guiding the factory gets a much more prominent and important job to do.
Important summary: This comparison shows, clearly, that the LISEC system and other competitors as well, are strongly dependent on batches. There is no easy way to modify this system gradually to reach a similar solution as provided by A+W Smart Factory. In fact, it requires reengineering the LISEC system! It is very likely that the same comments hold for the other competitors like Fenetech, Hanic, Synersoft. It could be helpful, if someone knowing those systems better would do a similar description of the simple production site as give above related to those systems.


## LISEC

Comparison versus Lisec (Lisec’s Autofab system is in competition with A+W DynOpt and A+W Smart Factory), things we have figured out from talking to Pressglass:

I wanted to share some observations regarding the Pressglass operations, particularly in relation to the Lisec Autofab system. It appears that many processes, such as buffer loading and table distribution, are still being manually controlled by a person. In contrast, we have automated these functions in our operations without human interaction, which enhances efficiency.

In the UK, it seems that the non-automated sections of the factory are distinctly separate from the automated areas. This separation makes it challenging to obtain comprehensive statistics, indicating that the Lisec automation system Autofab operates independently from the Lisec production software Liprod.
We optimize production dynamically, so planners shouldn’t worry about buffer size or overloading; orders are released as needed for just-in-time manufacturing, avoiding excess inventory. A+W uses within its “Pulling-Mode” available buffer slots to maximize material yield automatically, requiring minimal planner input.
We know the Rack Optimizer is better in A+W. At Pressglass, rack optimization with Lisec GPS-Rack is nearly a full-time job for one person per factory. With A+W Rack Optimizer, this workload drops by about 80–90%. A+W Rack Optimizer delivers strong optimization automatically, balancing weight and fully meeting complex end-customer packing requirements, whereas Lisec’s GPS-Rack often requires manual corrections via drag and drop by the user.
Please keep in mind that these observations are based solely on what we have seen and been informed about Pressglass. There is a possibility that they may not be utilizing the Lisec system to its full potential, similar to their previous use of A+W at the Kaunas facility.


## Fenevision / Fenetech

In general planning is ok for simple production, in case of complex production Fenetech comes to their limits. They have weaker capacity planning functionality than A+W. Configuration wise Fenetech is better, as every configuration is in DB, you do not have to work with INI files or other things. Good overview about Scheduling and capacity planning.
Regading the optimization Fenetech has no dynamic optimization or a pull mode. Also, on the machine side they have only limited connectivity in respect to A+W.
Fenetech claims that they also have dynamic optimization.  When a planned optimized job is released and cutting has started it can add additional jobs or breakages and automatically reoptimize the remaining of the glass together with it. This functionality is like what A+W Real time optimization can do using “Quick Opti”. However, in RTO this process of adding and reoptimizing needs to be done manually. The Fenetech functionality is far away from what A+W automation systems like A+W DynOpt and A+W Smart factory can do.

Above is how A+W customer Martin G Anderson described the Fenetech functionality when it was demonstrated and explained to them.


## Hegla-Hanic


## Optima


## Synersoft / Synerglass

To be confirmed: the rack optimizer from Synersoft is similar to the one provided by Lisec. It is more an advanced manual editor with basic pre grouping and presorting of the units on racks rather an advanced optimizer. The workload with employees planning is still high. Intensive manual interaction from human beings is necessary.


## Chinese equipment / Humam /

Comparison between the Blackbox Approach mostly used with Chinese hardware manufacturers and European Sorting Systems
In modern glass production, the efficiency of production processes plays a crucial role. The "Blackbox Approach," which is often associated with Chinese systems, utilizes a buffer where A+W Realtime Optimizer chaotically optimized sheets are not dynamically cut into the buffer. This method is characterized by very limited options in changing production sequences out of the buffer, meaning that adaptability to real-time changes in production is severely restricted.
In contrast, European sorting systems, such as those from manufacturers like Hegla, Lisec, or Forel, offer significant advantages together with A+W automation systems like A+W DynOpt or A+W Smart Factory. These systems are capable of dynamically re-sorting the produced sheets and optimizing them in real-time. This means that changes in production can be immediately interpreted and implemented. This flexibility allows production to be organized according to the pull principle, where production is driven by actual demand.
The Blackbox Approach, on the other hand, continues to follow the push approach where production is based on forecasts rather than actual requirements. The only advantage of this approach is that it requires less personnel for the transport of sheets, as conveyor systems and machines take over these tasks. This automation effect is of course also valid for pull-mode systems.
In summary, European sorting systems enable a significantly more efficient and flexible production method due to their ability for dynamic optimization and real-time adjustment. In contrast, the Blackbox Approach from mainly chines manufacturers, with its limited capabilities and push principle, falls short of the demands of modern, agile glass processing production.
