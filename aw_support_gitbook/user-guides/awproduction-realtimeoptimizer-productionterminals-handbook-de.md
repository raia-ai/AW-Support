short_description: "This document is a technical manual for the A+W Production software suite, covering the 'Zuschnitt' (Cutting) module and various 'Production Terminals'. It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for operators on tasks such as suppressing cutting code, interrupting cuts, and managing production workflows at different stations like IG-In, IG-Assembly, Manual Cutting, and more."
long_description: "This comprehensive user guide details the functionality of the A+W Production Realtime Optimizer and A+W Production Terminals, software designed for the glass, windows, and doors industry. The manual is divided into several key sections. The first part consists of 'Help Cards' (RTO 03-004 and RTO 03-005) that explain specific actions within the 'Zuschnitt' (Cutting) module, such as how to prevent the generation of a cutting code for a specific plate and how to interrupt a cutting process. The main body of the document is a detailed tutorial on the various A+W Production Terminals. It begins with a general overview of the production terminal system, its objectives, and its barcode-based operation. The manual then provides in-depth walkthroughs for each terminal, including IG-In (Insulating Glass Infeed), IG-Assembly, IG-Out, Manual Cutting, Georgian Bars, Order, Processing, TG-In (Tempering Glass Infeed), TG-Out, and LG-In (Laminated Glass Infeed). For each terminal, the guide presents the user interface, explains the purpose of each screen element, and provides a clear workflow for common tasks like loading jobs, handling damaged panes ('Bruch'), managing machine status, and generating reports. The document is intended for production staff who work directly at these terminals, aiming to make their workflows more efficient and straightforward."
