long_description: "This document is a comprehensive user manual and tutorial for the A+W Business Logistics Optimizer (OTR), a software module designed for planning and optimizing logistics and delivery routes. Written in German, the guide covers the fundamental concepts of OTR, starting with the initial setup of database connections to both the OTR and ERP systems. It details the user interface, including the main menu, symbol toolbars, and process flow visualization. The manual provides in-depth explanations of different operational modes, such as the 'dynamic mode,' which automatically groups destinations and performs geolocalization. A significant portion of the document is dedicated to the 'Administration' section, where users learn to manage master data, including users, statuses, customers, departments, vehicles, drivers, reports, and packaging materials (Packmittel). The tutorial walks users through the entire tour planning process, from importing data and creating new tours to managing destinations. It also covers tour optimization, explaining how to use various factors to refine routes for efficiency. Finally, the guide explains how to check optimization results, manage tour statuses, track actual tour costs, and monitor tours in real-time using the associated GDC (Goods Delivery Control) mobile app. The document is heavily illustrated with screenshots and includes detailed tables explaining the function of each icon and symbol within the software."
