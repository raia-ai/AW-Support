The Production Manager section covers the entire production workflow, starting from the 'Optimierungsübersicht' (Optimization Overview), which provides a summary of all optimizations. It explains how to interpret optimization results, manage selection criteria, and view details. The tutorial guides users through managing master data ('Stammdaten'), including setting up storage locations ('Abstellplätze'), defining criteria, and establishing sorting keys. It also details the process of generating outputs like reports and cutting codes for machinery. The software reference part provides in-depth explanations of all dialogs, fields, and functions in both expert and standard modes.

The Logistics Optimizer section focuses on tour and route planning. It begins with an editorial preface and a detailed table of contents. The tutorial explains the fundamental concepts of route optimization, the standard process (Plan -> Optimize -> Result), and how to work with the system to reduce transport costs and increase efficiency. It covers database connections, user administration, and the setup of master data such as vehicles, drivers, and customers."
