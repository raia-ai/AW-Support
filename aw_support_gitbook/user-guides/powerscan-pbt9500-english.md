POWERSCAN™ PBT9500


AIM, TRIGGER, DECODE: IT’S THAT SIMPLE!
An intuitive and effortless scanning
experience is the target of the PowerScan™
9500 series. They combine omnidirectional
reading capabilities, typical in all area
imaging scanners, with outstanding optical
characteristics. The result is a scanner
that is able to read any kind of bar code,
regardless of the orientation, from contact
to over 1.0 m / 3.3 ft, depending on the bar
code resolution.
MOBILITY ENHANCES PRODUCTIVITY
The PowerScan PBT9500 further enhances
operator efficiency and safety with
Bluetooth® wireless technology; no matter
if you need 1 or 100 meters of freedom:
you never need to worry about getting
tangled up in the cable. Accurate power
management allows long lasting battery
life to always guarantee more than one
shift of intensive scanning. Should you
need to operate 24/H, a quick 3-second
battery replacement combined with
a single or multi-slot battery charger
allows for continuous operation without
interruption.
