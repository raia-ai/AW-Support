## Features and Benefits

> The TC20 puts all the features you need to save time and money, increase sales and boost profitability in your store, right in the palm of your hand.

### Built for work
Drop it on the floor. Spill water on it. Use it in a dusty backroom, out in the rain, extreme heat or below freezing temperatures. The TC20 can handle it all.

### All day power — always
Running low on power? No problem. No need to find a charger — just snap on the unique PowerPack and keep on working.

### A real scanner for real time-savings
Smartphone cameras aren't built for barcode scanning — that's why the TC20 delivers the same scanning technology that most of the world's retailers rely on every day. You get instant and effortless point-and-shoot capture of any electronic or printed barcode in any condition — just like taking a photo. And if you have a task that requires the capture of a lot of barcodes, do it comfortably with the snap-on snap-off trigger handle.

### Instantly document everything
Document anything with the 8 MP autofocus color camera — from damage to a return to a copy of a driver's license for a credit card application.

### When it comes to service and support, we've got you covered
Get the right level of support for the right price with Zebra OneCare™ SV. You get two years of coverage for normal wear and tear and device failure, unmatched from-the-manufacturer technical support, a Device Diagnostics Tool for onsite troubleshooting, priority repair turnaround time, free return shipping, and more. All for a fraction of the cost of a single, uncovered repair.

### Easy to use — no learning curve
The TC20 brings the smartphone simplicity you want in a business tool — from Android to the bright screen that is easy to see indoors and outside, to the large display and three programmable buttons to instantly access your most used features and applications.

### Doubles as a walkie-talkie
Get the power of an instant voice connection — at no cost. With the press of a button, you can reach a specific worker, a specific group of workers, or all of your workers.*

### The fastest wireless connections
All wireless radios are not created equally. With the TC20, you not only get the fastest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, you get wireless connections that are as dependably solid and fast as wired connections.

### Charge it your way
The TC20 charging cradle couldn't be more versatile. Charge the all-touch or keyboard models with or without the PowerPack. Charge the all-touch model with or without the trigger handle. Or charge the PowerPack alone — all with one cradle. And the 5-slot universal ShareCradle enables the efficient, cost-effective use of space in the backroom.

### Entering barcodes into your apps couldn't be easier
Send barcodes captured with the scanner right into your existing apps with Zebra's DataWedge — no programming or modification of your existing apps required. The result? A big time-savings — without any cost.

> **GET BIG BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR SMALL BUSINESS.** For 45 years, Zebra has made innovative mobile devices that power the world's largest retailers, driving efficiency, sales and profitability into the store. Now, with the TC20, you can put that same innovation to work in your store.
