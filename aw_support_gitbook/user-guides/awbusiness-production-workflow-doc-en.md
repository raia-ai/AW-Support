short_description: "A tutorial for the A+W Business Production module, covering the process of transferring order data to production, both with and without capacity planning. It details manual and automatic transfer methods, system settings, and how to cancel transfers."
long_description: "This document serves as a comprehensive tutorial for the 'Transfer to Production' functionality within the A+W Business Production software. It is divided into several key sections. The first major section details how to transfer orders to production *without* capacity planning. This includes an overview of the benefits, prerequisites like system settings for SN files and number areas, and the setup of workflow tasks. It provides step-by-step instructions on configuring company data, transfer parameters (including OrderXML settings), and handling text/attachments. The document guides users through both manual transfer from a Number Manager and automatic transfer via workflow tasks. It also explains how to cancel a production transfer, both manually and in connection with automated workflows. The second major section covers transferring orders to production *with* A+W Business Capacity Planning. It highlights the differences from the previous method, focusing on how orders are first sent to the Capacity Planner for scheduling before being passed on to production. This section details the specific settings required in the company data's 'Capacity Planning' tab, such as version selection and error report handling. Finally, a smaller section touches on 'Transfer to Quotation Optimization,' explaining its purpose for pricing analysis and its limitations, particularly when capacity planning is active. The document uses screenshots of the software's user interface to illustrate the configuration steps."
