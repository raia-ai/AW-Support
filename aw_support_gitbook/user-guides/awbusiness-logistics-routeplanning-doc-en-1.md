long_description: "This document serves as a detailed software reference manual for the A+W Business Logistic Optimizer, specifically focusing on the 'Query' section of the application. It provides comprehensive instructions and descriptions for various features that allow users to manage and analyze route data. Key functionalities covered include filtering routes based on multiple criteria like date, status, driver, and vehicle. The manual explains how to export route data into standard formats like ITN (for TomTom) and GPX (for Garmin) for use with navigation systems. It also details the process for manually changing the status of a route (e.g., from 'Created' to 'Planned'). A significant portion is dedicated to the 'History' feature, which allows users to view a detailed log of route activities and document changes. The guide also covers the generation of various reports, such as the 'Confirmation and Delivery List,' which provides drivers with all necessary information for their routes. The extensive 'Statistics' section is broken down into several tabs (General, Graphic, Vehicles, Drivers, Departments, Customers), offering in-depth cost analysis, performance metrics, and data visualization through charts. Other features described include the 'Calendar' view for an overview of driver and vehicle assignments and the 'Attach Files' function for providing drivers with digital documents in the cloud."
