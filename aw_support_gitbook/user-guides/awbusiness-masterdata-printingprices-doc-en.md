## Printing Prices

Printing of prices on forms is defined at different points which may influence each other:

-   **Management of forms:** The settings are generally applicable and define whether the definition shall be adopted from the document.
-   **Partner management:** The settings define how detailed the prices shall be printed. These settings can be changed in the document.
-   **Product management:** These settings define whether the prices shall be shown implicitly or explicitly, e.g. for BOM elements.
-   **Document management (order):** The settings define how detailed the prices shall be printed. The settings will be adopted only if the settings in management of forms permit this.

### Management of forms: Settings for printing prices

Management of forms settings offers the following options:

-   **0 - Standard** or **2 - Print prices always (totals mode):**
    Printing of forms will use the details defined in the document:
    -   **0 - No printing:** Prices will not be printed.
    -   **1 - All prices:** Prices are printed per order item.
    -   **2 - Totals only:** Only item totals will be printed.
-   **1 - Always print prices:**
    The settings made in the document will be ignored. Prices will be printed per order item.
