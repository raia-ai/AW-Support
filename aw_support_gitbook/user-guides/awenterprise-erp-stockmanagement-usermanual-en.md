long_description: "This document serves as a detailed manual for two key modules of the A+W Enterprise software: Stock and Dispatch Control. It is divided into two main parts. The first part is a software reference guide that describes the user interface, dialogs, and functions within the Stock module. It covers topics such as booking status corrections, stock information lookups (pick lists, hit lists), inventory forecasting, managing available stock, printing labels, and system administration tasks like deleting logs and correcting prices. The second part consists of 'Help Cards' which are task-oriented tutorials. These cards provide step-by-step instructions for common operations in Master Data Management, Stock Management (booking in/out, warehouse operations), Inventory Management, Evaluation, and System tasks. The second half of the document is a similar comprehensive guide for the Dispatch Control module, covering its own software reference and tutorial sections. This includes an overview of dispatch modes, using the Dispatch Explorer, moving tours and orders, preparing dispatches, managing racks, and integrating with the A+W Logistics Optimizer. The guide is intended for users who work with logistics, inventory, and dispatch functions within the A+W Enterprise system, offering both high-level overviews and granular, field-by-field explanations."
