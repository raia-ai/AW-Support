long_description: "This document is a comprehensive tutorial for the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software, written in German. It is designed to guide users through the fundamental processes of creating and editing geometric shapes. The tutorial begins with an example demonstrating how to dimension different elements of a parallelogram, explaining the specific tools required for various measurements like length, vertical distance, and horizontal distance. It then progresses into a series of structured exercises (`Übungen`). Each exercise presents a specific shape to be created, such as a rectangle with a chamfered corner, an arrow shape, a parallelogram, and shapes with rounded corners or cutouts. For each exercise, the document provides a clear problem statement (`Aufgabenstellung`), a list of necessary tools (`Notwendige Werkzeuge`), and a detailed, step-by-step solution (`Lösung`). The tutorial also covers more advanced topics like creating and positioning internal contours (`Innenkonturen`), drill holes (`Bohrlöcher`), and cutouts (`Ausschnitte`), often by importing previously saved shapes. It emphasizes the correct use of dimensioning tools and provides tips on using the software's help features."
