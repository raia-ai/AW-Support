## Defining and editing of geometries

### Example

***Shape diagram with dimensions: 2099, 1495, 1427, 870, 980, 47°, 716.70***

The following tool is used to dimension the length of a straight line:

***Fig. A-21: Tool for length dimensioning***

This tool is used to dimension the straight lines 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Which tool is required for the size 716.70?**
1.  **Which line is the reference line for this sketch?** 1 is the reference line.
2.  **Is the corresponding size vertical or horizontal with the reference line?** The size to be dimensioned is vertical from the reference line.
3.  **Is the reference line involved?** Yes, the reference line is involved.

Now check the graphics List of tools for dimensioning:
The distance between a point and a line is measured. The size is vertical from the reference line, and the reference line is involved.

***Fig. A-22: Distance between two points parallel with a line***

**Which tool is required for the size 2099?**
1.  **Which line is the reference line for this sketch?** 1 is the reference line.
2.  **Is the corresponding size vertical or horizontal with the reference line?** The size to be dimensioned is horizontal from the reference line.
3.  **Is the reference line involved?** Yes, the reference line is involved.

Now check the graphics List of tools for dimensioning:
The distance between two points is measured. The size is horizontal from the reference line, and the reference line is involved.

## Exercises

This section tells you how to create and dimension sketches.

### Exercise 1: Create a rectangle with a cut-off corner
Draw a sketch based on the specifications below. This pattern is quite simple and serves as a preparation for more complex patterns.

**Trainer demo:**
The trainer shows the tools that are necessary to create the following shape.

**Tasks**
Open the program A+W CAD Designer (Shapes), select the appropriate view, and create the following shape:

***Fig. A-24: Task for exercise 1, Create rectangle (Dimensions: 1000, 500, 150, 100)***

Go to the appropriate view to check the result.

#### Exercise 1: Solution
Four tools are necessary to create this rectangle:
- Define a new straight line by entering the sizes
- Dimension the length of a line
- Define a right angle between two straight segments
- Dimension the distance between a point and a line

***Fig. A-25: Exercise 1: Tools required***

> **Tools - help**
> The description of tools is also available in the online help. Use Shift+F1 in menu ? to enable the context-sensitive help function. The cursor changes into a question mark preceded by an arrow. Click on the tool icon. A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) displays help text on the corresponding tool.

**Define the rectangle**
1.  Open the Sketch view.
2.  Select the tool for defining a straight line.
3.  Sketch the shape.
4.  Choose the tool for dimensioning a straight line.
5.  Mark the bottom, horizontal straight line. The input field appears.
6.  Enter a length of 1000 for D= in the input window. Press [OK].
7.  Mark the vertical straight line on the right. The input field appears.
8.  Enter a length of 500 for D= in the input window. Press [OK].
9.  Choose the appropriate tool for defining right angles between two straight segments.
10. Mark the vertical straight line on the left. It will be shown in red.
11. Mark the bottom, horizontal straight line. It will be shown in green.
12. Press [OK]. The colour of the straight line will be removed. The icon appears in the corner.
13. Repeat the process for the two remaining corners.
14. Select the tool for measuring the distance between a point and a straight line.

19. Using the function New sketch (View > New sketch or <Ctrl>+<D>), A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) checks whether the shape can be calculated or not. If all edges (segments) are shown in red, the shape has been sufficiently dimensioned, and can be calculated by the program.

***Fig. A-26: Result of exercise 1, Create rectangle***

> **Correct calculation of the contour**
> A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) can calculate the position of a contour only based on the sufficient amount of information/data. You can use the following formula to check which information is still missing:
>
> 2xL + 3xA - 3 = closed contour
> L: number of straight lines
> A: number of arcs

## Edge Cut-outs, Drill Holes, and Internal Contours

This section tells you how to define edge cut-outs, internal contours, and drill holes in A+W CAD Designer (Shapes).

This includes the following objectives:
- Procedure
- Cut-outs as separate files
- Exercises

### Processing in general

**Objectives**
- Introducing the view Internal contours and Edgework
- Learning the correct use of the tools in the views Internal contours and Edgework
- Positioning edgework and drill holes
- Exercises

**Benefit**
You will be able to use A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) efficiently only if you are familiar with the process and the tools.

**Definition**
- **Inside contours**: This view is used to position drill holes for example.
- **Edgework**: This view serves e.g. to define edgework.

**Note**
- **Cut-outs**: can be previously sketched and saved as separate geometries.
- **Tools**: The description of tools is also available in the online help. Click on the tool icon and press <F1>. A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) shows the help functions available for this tool.

### Procedure
After you have sketched and dimensioned the shape, edge cut-outs, drill holes, and Internal contours are positioned. Internal contours include cut-outs and drill holes. A special view (Internal contours) is available for this purpose. This view offers all options for positioning cut-outs and defining drill holes.

The technologies (cutting, drilling, etc.) consider the properties defined in this view. The position of a hole to be drilled will remain the same in the (following) technology views.

Previous views like Points, Sketch, or Geometry are not affected by this.

### Cut-outs as separate files
A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) allows to define simple (rectangles and arcs) or complex cut-outs. Complex cut-outs can be sketched as a separate geometry beforehand and saved as a SN file, or can be created in a separate file. If you save the cut-outs in a separate file, you can use them again whenever required. The geometry of cut-outs can be created in the same way as a common external geometry (has to be a closed contour). Cut-outs saved in a separate file can be loaded into the corresponding SN file.

### Exercises

This section tells you how to create internal contours.

#### Exercise 8: Create a rectangle with a cut-off corner and a cut-out
