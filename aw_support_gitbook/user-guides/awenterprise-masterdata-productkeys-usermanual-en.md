short_description: "This document is a software reference guide for A+W Enterprise, focusing on the 'Product Keys' section of the Master Data module. It details the configuration of product variants, sizes, exchange rules, technical values, and other product-related settings."
long_description: "This is a detailed technical manual for the A+W Enterprise software, specifically covering the 'Product Keys' and 'Article' master data management sections. The document provides comprehensive instructions on how to define and manage various product attributes. It begins with 'Variants', explaining how to set up individual product descriptions in multiple languages, including quantity units, variant text, and stock descriptions. It then moves to 'Exchange/additional rules', a powerful feature for creating customer-specific rules to modify Bills of Materials (BOMs) by adding or exchanging parts for specific articles or article types. The guide covers the setup of these rules in detail, including the 'Applies to', 'The Rule', 'Details', and 'Test Mode' tabs. Subsequent sections cover the configuration of technical value groups and vectors for properties like sound protection (dB), thermal properties (U), total energy transmission (g), and size restrictions. It also explains how to manage product standards, priorities, and CE-related information like Declaration of Performance (DoP) and product encoding. A significant portion is dedicated to the 'Article' master data itself, breaking down the configuration across various tabs: Identification, Physical Properties, Size Restrictions, Assembly Restrictions, Procurement, and Production. It also details A+W iQuote specific settings, such as processing assignments and group allocations, and concludes with instructions on managing customer-specific products and ordered processings. This guide is essential for administrators and advanced users responsible for setting up and maintaining the product catalog in A+W Enterprise."
