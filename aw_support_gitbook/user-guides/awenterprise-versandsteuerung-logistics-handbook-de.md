short_description: "This document is a technical software reference manual for the A+W Enterprise Shipping Control (Versandsteuerung) module. It provides detailed descriptions of functionalities, dialog boxes, and workflows related to managing finished goods, tours, and shipping documents."
long_description: "This comprehensive guide serves as a software reference for the A+W Enterprise Versandsteuerung (Shipping Control) module. It is divided into three main parts. The first part, 'Softwarereferenz', details core functionalities for managing racks (Gestelle) and finished goods inventory (Fertigwarenlager). This includes viewing stock levels, performing inventory counts (Inventur), and reviewing transaction logs (Protokoll). It also provides an in-depth guide to the various printing functions (Drucken), covering the generation of loading lists (Ladeliste), supplementary loading lists, advance delivery notes (Vorablieferschein), and final delivery notes (Lieferschein). The second part consists of 'Help Cards', which offer practical, step-by-step instructions for common user tasks. These cards cover workflows such as using the Shipping Explorer (Versand-Explorer), editing and shifting tours (Tour bearbeiten), preparing shipments (Versand vorbereiten) by checking for missing items or correcting quantities, and handling cancellations. The final part is a complete alphabetical 'Gesamtindex' (General Index), allowing users to quickly locate specific functions, terms, and dialogs within the A+W Enterprise system, making it an essential resource for both new and experienced users of the shipping module."
