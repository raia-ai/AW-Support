## The smartphone-style device that's made for work

### Power all your apps — simultaneously
Get superior performance on all your apps with a next generation processor that delivers twice the performance of the prior generation,¹ plus class-leading memory and data storage options.

### The best wireless has to offer
When it comes to wireless, the TC22/TC27 offers it all. 5G and Wi-Fi 6/6E² deliver wired speeds, providing workers with better voice and data performance inside and outside of your facility. Support for private 5G and CBRS³ private LTE networks enables cost-effective wireless connectivity in the largest indoor and outdoor facilities.

### Bluetooth 5.2
Bluetooth 5.2 delivers better audio quality while consuming less power, and adds unique features that enable effective ways to communicate and collaborate.

### The best of Android — today and tomorrow
Support through Android 16 ensures you won't outgrow the operating system — you'll have access to the latest features every day your device is in service.

### See more and scroll less with an advanced 6 in. FHD+ display
The larger screen delivers more display space and the bright 450 nits screen is easy to read anywhere — indoors and outside.

### Capture barcodes in less time — with less effort
Compared to scanning with a mobile phone camera, Zebra's enterprise-class scanning options enable workers to capture barcodes in nearly half the time, with half the muscle work.⁴ Choose from the SE4710 1D/2D standard scan engine or the SE55 1D/2D Advanced Range scan engine with IntelliFocus™ technology, able to scan items in hand or on the highest warehouse shelf. Both options deliver split second first time capture of virtually every barcode, regardless of condition.

### Ready for the world of contactless transactions
Easily integrate the TC22/TC27 with your existing POS contactless payment solution, allowing customers to simply tap to pay. In addition, the built-in support for Apple VAS and Google SmartTap enables the TC22/TC27 to read tickets, loyalty and gift cards, boarding passes and more stored in Apple or Google wallets.

## Ergonomically designed for all day comfort
The TC22/TC27 is nearly 10% thinner than its predecessor, with a contoured surface that reduces pressure points and provides a more secure and comfortable grip for any size hand.

## A durable design built to last for years
The TC22/TC27 is waterproof, dustproof, drop-proof and tumble-proof, thanks to an improved design, IP68 sealing, plus drop and tumble tests that are even more aggressive than the industry standard MIL-STD 810H and IEC. And shatter-and-scratch-resistant Corning® Gorilla® Glass protects two of the most vulnerable features — the display and scanner exit window.

## Power every minute of every workday
Choose the battery that will keep pace with your workers — the standard 3800 mAh battery for full shift power; the extended 5200 mAh battery for multi-shift power. With removable batteries, you never need to take the device out of service for charging.

## Purpose-built accessories make every job easier
Single- and multi-slot cradles meet every charging challenge — from desktop to backroom. Make scan-intensive tasks easy with a snap-on trigger handle. Give workers instant hands-free freedom with a wearable arm mount. Boost ruggedness with a protective boot ideal for workers in the field. Make carrying easier with a holster or a handstrap — from the retail store to delivery drivers on the road.

## The Zebra-only difference — Mobility DNA

### Get a built-in advantage with no-cost Mobility DNA Professional
Increase security and simplify deployment, management and data capture with these ready-to-use free tools. Add powerful enterprise features to standard Android. Stage devices with your apps, network settings and more in seconds. Control the applications and features workers can access to protect productivity. Enter barcodes into your apps right out of the box — no programming required. Keep your devices secure every day they are in service with timely Android updates and patches. Control the GMS apps and services that are available on your devices. Collect targeted diagnostics for easier troubleshooting. Test all main device systems with the press of a button.

### Maximize device functionality, workforce productivity and the user experience with the optional Mobility DNA Enterprise license
Simultaneously capture all the barcodes you need, even if they are on multiple labels, all with just a single press of the scan button. Capture and crop a document image, detect signature presence and capture a barcode in one button press. Simplify data entry with a customized soft keyboard. Provide unsurpassed 'won't drop' wired style Wi-Fi connections every minute of every shift. Simplify Bluetooth accessory management. Turn Workstation Connect cradles into powerful workstations with Workstation Connect software.⁵ And powerful additional licensable tools add even more value. Track and locate missing devices that are equipped with a BLE battery, even if the battery is dead.⁶ Use the cloud to easily deploy, configure and manage all of your Mobility DNA tools — anywhere and anytime.⁷

## Bring more value with added functionality

### Create a mobile-driven workstation or hybrid Point-of-Sale (POS)
The Workstation Connect solution lets you instantly create a workstation on demand or a POS station — just connect a monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner or a payment terminal to a Connect cradle and dock your device. No need to purchase and manage separate fixed workstations. And using devices you already own to create POS stations on demand, allows you to add and place POS stations when and where you need them — without expensive cabinetry or rearranging your store.

### Create a lightning-fast RFID reader
Take inventory in record time with the standard range RFD40 UHF RFID sleds and the standard- or extended-range RFD90 Ultra-Rugged UHF RFID sleds. Connect via Zebra's eConnex™ adaptor or hassle-free Bluetooth — and easily manage sleds over-the-air via Wi-Fi.⁹

### Turn the TC22/TC27 into a two-way radio and PBX handset
Add push-to-talk (PTT) over Wi-Fi, right out of the box. Quickly and easily give workers out in the field the power of PTT over the cellular network and secure messaging with a cost-effective subscription service. And add fully-featured PBX handset functionality with a custom interface that makes it easy to execute even the most complex telephony features.¹⁰ The result? You get more out of the devices you already own. There are fewer devices to purchase and manage, reducing costs — and creating a greener enterprise.
