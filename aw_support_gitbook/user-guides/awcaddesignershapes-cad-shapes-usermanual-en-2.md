short_description: "A detailed user manual for the 'Tools' section of the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software. It covers functions for adding auxiliary lines, processing corners (cutting, rounding, sharpening), defining cut-outs, and applying surface treatments to 2D designs."
long_description: "This document is a comprehensive guide to the various tools available in the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software, focusing on the manipulation and detailing of 2D contours for manufacturing processes, likely in the glass or stone industry. It provides step-by-step instructions for a wide range of functions. Key areas covered include: adding and defining auxiliary lines for precise dimensioning; comprehensive corner processing tools such as cutting off corners, creating radii and chamfers, and sharpening corners; methods for rounding and sharpening contours; creating and positioning complex inside contours like cut-outs and holes, including grouping them as macros for reuse; defining various surface treatments like coatings, frosting, sandblasting, and printing; and setting up surface stripping and lines for fluted bevelling. The manual is intended for CAD operators who prepare designs for CNC machinery, detailing how to use each tool, including its parameters and expected outcomes, to ensure accurate and efficient production."
