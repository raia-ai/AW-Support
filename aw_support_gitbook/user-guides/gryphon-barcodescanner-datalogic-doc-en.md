## ENHANCED LINEAR IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

The Gryphon™ 4200 series represents the premium range of hand held scanners from Datalogic for general purpose applications.

Designed with people in mind, the Gryphon I GD4200 linear imager stands out with an elegant and trendy design, unchallenged ergonomics and outstanding reading performance. The Gryphon I GD4200 readers' ability to capture bar codes from near to far, to read both high-density and low-resolution codes, to decode hard-to-read, poor or damaged codes and to easily read bar codes from mobile devices make these readers the perfect choice for today's and tomorrow's applications.

## TOP PRODUCTIVITY FOR POS AND DOCUMENT HANDLING

Perfect for hand held reading, the Gryphon I GD4200 linear imager utilizes Datalogic's Motionix™ motion-sensing technology which detects the natural actions of the operator to automatically switch the scanner into the 'ready-to-read' scanning mode.

Datalogic’s distinctive 'soft line viewfinder' helps operator to easily target the code to be read, making it easier and faster to point, shoot and decode exactly the proper label, reducing accidental reads in a multiple bar code environment.

## EASY TO USE FOR MAX EFFICIENCY

The Gryphon I GD4200 linear imager provides snappy reading performance on all common 1D codes and thanks to the Datalogic's exclusive patented 'Green Spot' for good-read feedback directly on the code is ideal under dim lighting conditions or noisy environments.

Furthermore, Datalogic's 3GL™ (Three Green Lights) and loud beeper for good-read feedback together with the fast reading and decoding capabilities make the Gryphon I GD4200 readers the best choice to improve efficiency in retail and office environments, pharmacies, light industrial, warehouses and manufacturing plants.

## READY TO BE REGULARLY CLEANED AND DISINFECTED

Most of the working environments now have requirements that scanners need to be regularly cleaned and disinfected. The Gryphon 4200 series exploits Disinfectant-Ready enclosures, designed to withstand regular daily cleaning with harsh disinfectant solutions commonly used in a healthcare environment.
