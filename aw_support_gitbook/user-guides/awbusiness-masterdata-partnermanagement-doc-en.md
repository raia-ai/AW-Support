long_description: "This comprehensive software reference manual provides detailed instructions for managing master data within the A+W Business software. The guide begins by explaining general settings, such as how to define and lock states for partners, which is crucial for handling different VAT codes within a country. It then moves on to 'Classifiers,' a feature used to enter technical parameters and other categorizations for partners, products, customers, and suppliers. The document distinguishes between classifiers for all market partners and those specific to products. The core of the manual is dedicated to 'Partner Management,' a central dialog for entering and maintaining data for customers, suppliers, and other partners. It meticulously describes the various menus (Functions, Options, Print) and the numerous tabs within the Partner Management dialog. These tabs include 'Address' (for contact and shipping information), 'Order' (for setting defaults related to order entry, invoicing, and delivery), 'Employee/Subsidiaries/Transactions,' 'Text' (for standard and custom text modules), 'Classifiers' (for value allocation), and 'Finances' (for bank details, tax information, and due date calculations). Each field and option is explained in detail, often with cross-references to related tutorials and settings elsewhere in the system."
