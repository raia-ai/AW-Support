short_description: "This document provides a comprehensive overview of the dimensioning tools available in the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software, covering segment, angle, circle, arc, and hole dimensioning."
long_description: "This is a detailed technical manual for the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software, focusing specifically on the 'Use of Tools' for creating and defining shapes. The document is structured into several major sections: Segment Dimensioning, Dimensioning of Angles, Dimensioning of Circles and Arcs, Automatic Dimensioning, and Input and Dimensioning of Holes. Each section begins with a summary table of the available tools, including their icons, short names, and descriptions. Following the tables, each tool is explained in detail with step-by-step instructions on its usage, including how to select points and segments, enter values, and confirm actions. The manual uses illustrations and examples to clarify complex operations. It also provides important warnings, such as avoiding coordinate-based dimensioning for contours that may be rotated later. This guide is an essential reference for CAD operators and technicians using the A+W software to ensure accurate and efficient creation of dimensioned shapes."
