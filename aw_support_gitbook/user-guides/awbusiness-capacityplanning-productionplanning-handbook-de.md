long_description: "This document is a detailed German-language guide for the A+W Business Pro software, focusing on the \"Kapazitätsplanung\" (Capacity Planning) module. It functions as both a tutorial, with practical examples and step-by-step instructions, and a software reference that systematically details all relevant dialogs and settings. The guide covers the foundational aspects of capacity planning, including the setup of master data (Stammdaten) like machine aggregates (Aggregate), work types (Arbeitsarten), and operational restrictions. It explores various scenarios for machine selection based on priority, technical constraints, and order quantity. The document explains how to manage production scheduling through both backward and forward scheduling, taking into account transition times, downtimes, and shift calendars. It also provides strategies for resolving capacity bottlenecks, such as order splitting (Positionssplit) and rescheduling. Further sections delve into production cost calculation, processing production feedback (Rückmeldungen) to update order status, and utilizing the \"Leitstand\" (control station) for real-time monitoring and manual adjustments to the production plan. The guide is intended for system administrators and power users responsible for configuring, managing, and optimizing production capacity within the A+W Business Pro ERP environment."
