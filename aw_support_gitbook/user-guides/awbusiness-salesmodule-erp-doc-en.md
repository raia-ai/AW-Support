#### Tutorial structure

This tutorial consists of thematic blocks with several training modules each. Each module consists of the following elements:

*   **Overview**
    Each training module starts with an overview of the major topics:
    *   Objectives: What shall be conveyed?
    *   Benefit: What can this knowledge be used for?
    *   Maxims: Which correlations are to be remembered?

    First, the concepts and terms of the corresponding training module will be explained. This is followed by examples and instructions.
*   **Exercises**
    For some of the modules, exercises with certain tasks and suggested solutions are available.
*   **Cross-references**
    At the end of each training module there is a section with cross references pointing out additional information in the software reference and in other sections. This will help you to extend your newly acquired knowledge.

#### Reading instructions

The contents of a training module are based on the knowledge conveyed in the previous module. We therefore recommend not to skip any modules.

If you are already familiar with a subject, you should at least read the summary at the start of the module in order to bring the main details to mind.

#### Display conventions

Certain parts of sentences are specially marked. The meanings are:

*   **Italic**: marks character strings describing the software elements, e.g., the *Number manager* dialog.
*   **Bold**: marks character strings to be entered via the keyboard, e.g.: Enter the value **0**.
*   **>**: The so-called breadcrumb trail shows how to open a dialog, e. g. Production > Production > Transfer to production.
*   **[]**: Square brackets mark buttons in a dialog, e. g. [OK] to save the data.
*   **< >**: Angle brackets refer to keys or shortcuts on the keyboard, e. g. `<F1>` is used to open the online help.

### Basic Principles of Sales

Sales belongs to the commercial tasks within a company. Sales is typically structured in this or a similar way in A+W Business:

*(The document includes a schema diagram illustrating the sales workflow. The process begins with a **Quotation**, which leads to an **Order**. The Order can trigger a **P.O.** (Purchase Order) and also feeds into **Production**. Goods from a P.O. are processed via a **Goods receipt**. The workflow culminates in a **Delivery/partial delivery note**, followed by an **Invoice/Partial invoice**. A separate path shows that a **Complaint** can lead to a **Credit note**.)*

*   **Quotation:**
    In a quotation you offer your services at a certain price to your customer. A quotation can also include alternative items or specifications.
*   **Order:**
    An order defines the customer's purchase order. Order processing includes the input and editing of order items, order-relevant customer data and determination of the price.
*   **P.O. transfer:**
    Information on the articles to be bought are passed on to purchasing. A+W Business creates a purchasing suggestion based on the order.
*   **Transfer to production:**
    Order items to be produced are transferred to production. A+W Business can automatically enter the data into capacity planning.
*   **Delivery note/partial delivery note:**
    When you deliver your goods, you hand your customer a delivery note stating all items shipped. If you ship only part of the ordered goods, you can issue a partial delivery note.
*   **Invoice/partial invoice:**
    When the order and shipment have been performed, you issue an invoice for the goods and the services performed. Invoices can be split into several partial invoices or combined as collective invoices.

The (automatic) processing of documents is controlled by the respective status. This is why status allocation has to be complete and correct.

All commercial transactions in A+W Business are based on the master data. Sales can only be processed properly if the master data is accurate and up to date.

#### Sales process

Sales documents are usually processed by means of the following steps:

*   Create quotation (optional)
*   Order
    *   Enter header data
    *   Enter items
    *   Edit bill of material, add shape and grills
*   Print (send) order confirmation
*   Transfer purchase orders
*   Transfer production data
*   Correct dates and route planning based on feedback
*   Check completion reports
*   Print delivery note
*   Print invoice
*   Transfer invoice to financial accounting
*   Transfer documents to archives and statistics
*   Delete document from main database

> **Daily procedure**
> The easiest way of arranging your daily procedure is using the number managers. Empty the corresponding number manager or create a new one for that day.
> Now create the new documents in this number manager. This helps you keep track of the documents that are new and can or have to be processed.
