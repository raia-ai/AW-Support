long_description: "This document is a comprehensive tutorial (Tutorial 1) from the A+W Business software manual, focused on 'Stammdaten für Preise' (Master Data for Prices). It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for managing the complex pricing structures within the A+W Business ERP system, which is commonly used in the glass and window manufacturing industries. The tutorial guides users through defining, editing, and deleting tariffs, which are combinations of price years and price keys. It explains how to create various price tables, including single prices (Einzelpreis), model-based prices (Modellpreis), and muntin bar prices (Sprossenpreis). A significant portion is dedicated to understanding and applying different types of surcharges, such as group surcharges, exchange surcharges, model processing surcharges, and other miscellaneous surcharges. The document also elaborates on creating tiered or scaled pricing using different limit types (Grenztypen) in formats like vectors, matrices, and cubes. It details the use of special features like WGR Fremdkey for price assignment via product groups and the Bearbeitungsindex (processing index) for weighting effort and difficulty. Furthermore, the tutorial covers the copy function, allowing users to efficiently duplicate and modify entire price lists for new periods or customers. The guide is richly illustrated with screenshots and diagrams to clarify the user interface and the procedural steps."
