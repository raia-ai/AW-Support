short_description: "A comprehensive user manual for A+W CAD Designer (Shapes), detailing the use of various tools for defining and processing glass contours. It covers operations for single annealed, laminated, and IG units, including hole creation, edgework, and file management."
long_description: "This document is the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) Overview manual, specifically focusing on the 'Use of Tools' and 'General Operation' sections. It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for a wide range of functions within the software. The manual covers defining holes for different glass systems (like Planar and Integra), processing single annealed edges (grinding, polishing, mitring, bevelling), and specialized edgework for laminated and IG (Insulated Glass) units. It also explains how to define lite sequences for multi-layer units. The 'General Operation' section describes fundamental software interactions, such as using the elastic band for measurement, zooming, and selecting elements with the cursor tool. The guide further details file management operations, including opening, saving, importing (from DXF, Block.IND, etc.), and exporting files, as well as printing drawings. It also covers essential editing functions like undo/restore, grouping elements, and transforming contours (moving, rotating, scaling). A 'Fixed Questions' section addresses common user workflows, such as entering contours via digitizing or sketching, post-processing imported data, and aligning contours for production."

## Tools

### The Use of Tools

- **I:I** = IG unit
- **I** = single annealed lite or laminated unit

6. Confirm your entry by `<ENTER>` or `[OK]`. The holes are added to the contour and shown in segment colour.
