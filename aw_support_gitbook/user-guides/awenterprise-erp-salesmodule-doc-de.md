The document is structured as a series of task-oriented cards, each addressing a specific function within the sales workflow. Topics covered range from initial customer interactions, such as creating quick quotes (Schnellerfassung) and formal offers (Angebot), to detailed order processing (Auftrag), including order entry, configuration, and management of order items (Auftragsposition). It also details complex procedures like price calculation (Preisberechnung), invoicing (Rechnung), and creating credit notes (Gutschrift). The guide is intended for end-users of the A+W Enterprise software, providing clear, numbered workflows, prerequisites, and additional information for each task. The software is specialized for the glass, windows, and doors industry, and the help cards reflect industry-specific processes like handling CAD data (SN-Datei), configuring multi-pane glass (Stufenglas), and managing glazing beads (Sprossen)."
