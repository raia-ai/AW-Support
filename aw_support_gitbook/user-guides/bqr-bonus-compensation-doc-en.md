# Change in BQR Bonus

**TL;DR:**
The "Performance Factor Target” is being discontinued and replaced by the "Personal Factor," simplifying the bonus calculation without affecting the payout, effective from 2025.

---
## Q: What is being changed?

**A:** The “Performance Factor Target” will be discontinued. The previous “Personal Target Bonus in %" will be converted into the “Personal Factor.”

| **Organisation** | A+W Software GmbH | **Approved by** | xxx |
| **Staff number** | 1234 | **Date** | |
| **Annual base salary** | 60.000 € | **Personal Factor** | **0,347** |

| Split | Entity | Bonus Type | Annual base salary | Personal Factor | Perf. Factor FC 2025 | Bonus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100% | A+W Global | Individual Bonus | **60.000 €** | **0,347** | 26,60% | **5.542 €** |
| **Total Bonus** | | | | | | **5.542 €** |

## Q: Why is the change being made?

**A:**
- The BQR Bonus considers EBITA (profit) and NRG (growth) in the “Performance Factor Target.”
- These metrics have not been adjusted in the bonus matrix in recent years to avoid a negative effect on the bonus.
- The EBITA target is still at 28% and the growth target (NRG) at 7%, although the current CSI targets are at 30% and 10%.
- The difference between the previous values and the current CSI targets is now too large.
- With the previous bonus model, there would have been a need to adjust the targets, which would have had a negative impact on the individual employee's bonus due to higher targets.
- Therefore, it was decided to exclude these two metrics (EBITA and NRG target) from the calculation to avoid target adjustments every couple of years.

### Old Performance Factor Target

Forecast: A+W Global
| | Target | FC 2025 | FC 2026 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBITA** | 28,00% | 29,00% | 30,00% |
| **NRG** | 7,00% | 10,00% | 5,00% |
| **Performance Factor** | **23,04%** | **26,60%** | 24,00% |

### New Performance Factor (Without Fixed Target)

Forecast: A+W Global
| | FC 2025 | FC 2026 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBITA** | 29,00% | 30,00% |
| **NRG** | 10,00% | 5,00% |
| **Performance Factor** | 26,60% | 24,00% |

### Hypothetical Impact of Target Adjustment
If we would have changed the targets to 30% EBITA and 10%, this is how it would have impacted your bonus:

**Old target as previously:**
- **Bonus:** 5.542 €

**New target with higher EBITA & NRG:**
- **Bonus:** 4.560 €

You can see that this change would have decreased your bonus in this exemplary scenario by -982€ (5.542€ - 4.560€)

## Q: How is the new "Personal Factor" calculated?

**A:** As the fixed variable “Performance Factor Target” is removed, the new "Personal Factor" is calculated as follows:
> **(Personal Target Bonus in %) / (OLD Performance Factor Target) = NEW Personal Factor**

If your Personal Target Bonus is for example 8% and given the old Performance Factor Target of 23,04%, this is the calculation:
> **0,08 / 0,2304 = 0,347222222...**

Simplified, this means that:
> **"Personal Target Bonus in %" x 4,34027777777778 = "NEW Personal Factor"**

Here is a chart of the conversion:

| Personal Target (old) | Personal Factor (new) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 5% | 0,217013889 |
| 6% | 0,260416667 |
| 7% | 0,303819444 |
| 8% | 0,347222222 |
| 9% | 0,390625 |
| 10% | 0,434027778 |
| 11% | 0,477430556 |
| 12% | 0,520833333 |
| 13% | 0,564236111 |
| 14% | 0,607638889 |
| 15% | 0,651041667 |
| 16% | 0,694444444 |
| 17% | 0,737847222 |
| 18% | 0,78125 |
| 19% | 0,824652778 |
| 20% | 0,868055556 |
| 21% | 0,911458333 |
| 22% | 0,954861111 |
| 23% | 0,998263889 |
| 24% | 1,041666667 |
| 25% | 1,085069444 |

> **Important reminder:** If you were affected by the conversion of the employee bonus in 2023, your Personal Target displayed on your bonus matrix might be a rounded value.

## Q: Does the change affect the payout amount I receive?

**A:** No, the old target values (28% EBITA / 7% NRG) will continue to serve as the basis. The final result remains identical, regardless of whether the traditional or the new method is applied.

## Q: When will the change take effect?

**A:** The new model will be implemented from 2025. The matrices for 2024 (payout in April 2025) will still be calculated using the traditional method.

## Q: Why is the new “Personal Factor” not given as a percentage?

**A:** The value is now presented as a number to align with the common practice of CSI.

## Q: Why is the “Personal Target Bonus in local currency” being discontinued?

**A:** This value was previously based on the annual salary and the "Personal Target Bonus in %." With the new Personal Factor, this calculation is no longer possible. However, the entire bonus will still be represented based on the expected EBITA and NRG values of the respective business unit.

## Q: What other side effects are there?

**A:** The calculation is simplified by the elimination of a variable and is now easier to understand.

**Old Calculation:**
`100% x 60.000€ x 8% x (26,60% / 23,04%) = 5.542€`

**New Calculation:**
`100% x 60.000€ x 0,347222 x 26,60% = 5.542€`

## Q: What do certain terms mean?

**A:**
- **EBITA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization):** A measure of a business unit's operating profit before interest, taxes, and amortization.
- **NRG (Net Revenue Growth):** The growth in a business unit's net revenue over a specific period.
