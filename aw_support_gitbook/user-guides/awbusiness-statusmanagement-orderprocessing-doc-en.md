short_description: "A tutorial for the A+W Business Sales software, detailing procedures for managing document statuses, allocating lock codes, setting user rights, and copying documents like orders and quotations."
long_description: "This document is a detailed tutorial from the A+W Business Sales software manual, focusing on two primary areas: Status Management and Document Copying. The 'Status' section explains how to manage and interpret document statuses, covering both automatic status changes triggered by system events (e.g., printing an invoice) and manual status changes. It provides step-by-step instructions for allocating lock codes to restrict document actions based on their status and for changing the status of individual orders, multiple orders, or all orders within a number manager. The guide also covers the configuration of user rights to control which users can perform manual status changes, ensuring data integrity and proper workflow. The 'Copy Documents' section describes the functionality for creating new documents (like orders) by copying existing ones (such as quotations or archived orders). It explains how to copy an entire document or select specific items to copy, and how to make adjustments during the copying process. The tutorial uses screenshots, tables, and labeled diagrams to illustrate the user interface and provide practical examples for daily business operations."

## Status Tutorial

4. If the status is not to be allocated to all documents, please choose the required document type (B).
   If the status shall apply to more than one document type but not for all document types, you must repeat the entire allocation process for every document type.
5. Choose the user status (C) that you want to allocate to the status point and document type.
6. If necessary, also define the suitable minimum status and the lock status.
7. Go to the menu Start > Save to save the data. The data will be saved.
8. Repeat the steps if the allocation shall apply to several document types.

If your test documents were processed flawlessly, you can adopt the changes for your daily business.

### ■ How to allocate a lock code
1. Select **Master data > Order > Lock code**. The dialog **Lock code** opens.
