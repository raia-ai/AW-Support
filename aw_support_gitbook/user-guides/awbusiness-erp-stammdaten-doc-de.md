long_description: "This comprehensive technical document serves as a reference guide for the A+W Business software, specifically detailing the functionalities within the master data module. The chapter begins with an in-depth exploration of 'Preisverwaltung' (Price Management), explaining how to configure various pricing structures such as single prices (Einzelpreis), model-based prices (Modell), prices for muntin bars (Sprossen), and cube-based pricing (Würfel). It also covers the use of price formulas and the management of price lists, including functions for changing, copying, and deleting prices, as well as importing and exporting price matrices. The second major section, 'Lager' (Inventory), describes the setup of inventory-related master data, including defining packaging types, structuring warehouse locations across different levels (Ebenen), creating warehouse definitions, and managing inventory categories and locations for specific machinery (Aggregate). The final and most extensive section, 'Marktpartner' (Market Partners), details the management of master data for customers, suppliers, and other business partners. It covers general settings like groups, industries, and projects, and provides a thorough walkthrough of the 'Partnerverwaltung' (Partner Management) dialog. This includes managing addresses, order parameters, financial data (credit limits, payment terms), sales information, production settings, and assigning classifiers. The document also explains the detailed administration of customer-specific data, such as discount management (Rabattverwaltung), which includes setting up general, tiered, and exchange discounts."
