long_description: "This document serves as a comprehensive user manual and software reference for the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) program. It is divided into two main parts: Software Reference and Tools. The first part covers the primary user interface elements and information dialogs accessible through the main menus. This includes the 'Input window' for entering processing parameters, 'Text format' and 'Lines and fillings' for printout customization, 'BOM Info' for viewing product structure data, and the 'Window' and 'Help' menus for file management and user assistance. The second, more extensive part focuses on the 'Tools' available for creating and manipulating shapes. It provides a detailed table of contents and explains the general operation. The tools are grouped by function, such as 'Tools for contour input' (detailing digitizing via digitizer, virtual digitizing, and importing contours), 'Dimensioning tools', 'Corner processing tools', 'Tools for processing inside contours', 'Tools for surfaces', and specialized tools for technologies like automotive and architectural glass processing. The guide includes step-by-step instructions, descriptions of tool icons, and important operational notes for each function, making it an essential resource for users to effectively design and process shapes within the A+W CAD environment."
