---
## The ultimate cost-effective touch computer built for small and big business

If you're considering purchasing low-cost mobile phones for your workers, step up to the TC21/TC26 Touch Computers — without stepping up in price. All the right business features help your workers capture and access the data they need to act faster and more efficiently. The right rugged design delivers reliable operation, day in and day out. The right business class accessories makes the TC21/TC26 easier to use and easier to manage. With multiple configurations at different price points, you pay only for the features your workers need, including connectivity — the WiFi-only TC21 for workers inside the four walls or the WiFi/cellular TC26 for workers out in the field. Powerful complimentary Mobility DNA tools are pre-loaded and ready to use, making it easier to stage, secure and troubleshoot devices; capture and send data to your applications right out of the box; restrict access to features and applications; and more. And the Mobility DNA Enterprise License delivers premium voice capabilities over WiFi and unlocks a powerful data toolkit that takes workforce productivity and device management simplicity to a new level.

## Key Features

**Superior Voice Quality and Functionality**
