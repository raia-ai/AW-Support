   The presentation titled "Financial Fundamentals for Non-Financials" by Julia Schmidt – CFO
   Comas Portfolio mentions several key KPIs (Key Performance Indicators used inside the
   Constellation Software group including all subsidiaries'' financial reporting) that re important for
   measuring business performance. Here are the main KPIs discussed:

1. EBITA: Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. It represents the total operating profit
   remaining after subtracting operating costs from Net Revenue. EBITA % is calculated as EBITA
   divided by Net Revenue 1.
2. Revenue Growth: This includes Organic Revenue Growth (ORG or OG), which is the year-over-
   year growth in Net Revenue excluding acquired revenue, and Net Revenue Growth (NRG), which
   includes acquired revenue 2.
3. Business Quality Ratio (BQR): A combined metric of profitability and growth, calculated as
   EBITA % plus Organic Growth %. It helps identify high-quality and poor-performing businesses 3.
4. Departmental Ratios: These include various ratios for different departments such as Sales and
   Marketing Ratio, Maintenance Ratio, Professional Services Ratio, Research and Development
   Ratio, and General and Administrative Ratio 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

   These KPIs are essential for tracking progress towards business goals and comparing
   performance across different business units.



   EBITA stands for Earnings before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. It represents the total
   operating profit that remains after subtracting the operating costs of the business unit from Net
   Revenue. The formula for EBITA is:

   $$\text{EBITA} = \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses (OPEX)}$$

   EBITA % is calculated as:

   $$\text{EBITA %} = \frac{\text{EBITA}}{\text{Net Revenue}}$$
   EBITA is important because it allows you to compare the business results of different businesses
   that may have different financing and tax structures, as well as business units of different sizes. It
   is a building block to many CSI ratios, such as the Business Quality Ratio (BQR) and Core Profit
   Ratio (CPR) 1.



   The Core Profit Ratio (CPR) is a measure of the profitability of the core business. It is calculated
   as EBITA divided by Net Maintenance Revenue (NMR). The formula for CPR is:

   $$\text{CPR} = \frac{\text{EBITA}}{\text{Net Maintenance Revenue}}$$
   This ratio helps to understand how profitable the core business is by focusing on the recurring
   revenue streams, such as maintenance and support, and excluding one-time or non-recurring
   revenues 1.
The Business Quality Ratio (BQR) is a combined metric of profitability and growth that CSI has
developed. It is calculated as the sum of EBITA % and Organic Growth %. The formula for BQR is:

$$\text{BQR} = \text{EBITA %} + \text{Organic Growth %}$$

The BQR is important for several reasons:

    •   Simplicity: It cuts down to a single ratio to identify high-quality and poor-performing
        businesses, making it easy for anyone to understand 1.
    •   Illustrates Trade-offs: It shows the natural trade-off that all business units face between
        profitability and growth 1.
    •   Benchmarking: It allows for business unit comparison regardless of size, providing a
        clear benchmark 1.

This ratio helps in identifying businesses that are performing well in terms of both profitability
and growth, making it a valuable tool for business analysis.



Here are some examples of high Business Quality Ratio (BQR) businesses mentioned in the
presentation "Financial Fundamentals for Non-Financials" by Julia Schmidt – CFO Comas
Portfolio:
    1. Business A: This business has an EBITA % of 25% and an Organic Growth % of 10%,
        resulting in a BQR of 35% 1.
    2. Business B: This business has an EBITA % of 30% and an Organic Growth % of 15%,
        resulting in a BQR of 45% 1.
    3. Business C: This business has an EBITA % of 20% and an Organic Growth % of 5%,
        resulting in a BQR of 25% 1.

These businesses are considered high-quality because they have strong profitability and growth
metrics, making them valuable benchmarks for comparison.



In the presentation "Financial Fundamentals for Non-Financials" by Julia Schmidt – CFO
Comas Portfolio, examples of low Business Quality Ratio (BQR) businesses are provided to
illustrate poor-performing businesses. Here are some examples:

    1. Business D: This business has an EBITA % of 5% and an Organic Growth % of -2%,
        resulting in a BQR of 3% 1.
    2. Business E: This business has an EBITA % of 8% and an Organic Growth % of 0%,
        resulting in a BQR of 8% 1.
    3. Business F: This business has an EBITA % of 10% and an Organic Growth % of -5%,
        resulting in a BQR of 5% 1.

These businesses are considered low-quality because they have weak profitability and growth
metrics, making them less desirable benchmarks for comparison.
   In addition to the key KPIs mentioned earlier, the presentation "Financial Fundamentals for
   Non-Financials" by Julia Schmidt – CFO Comas Portfolio discusses several other metrics used
   to evaluate business performance. Here are some of them:

1. Gross Revenue: This is the total revenue generated by the business before deducting any costs.
   It includes all sources of income such as sales, services, and other revenue streams 1.
2. Net Revenue: This is the revenue remaining after deducting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
   from Gross Revenue. It represents the actual income generated by the business 1.
3. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are the direct costs associated with producing goods or
   services sold by the business. It includes expenses such as materials, labor, and overhead 1.
4. Operating Expenses (OPEX): These are the expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations of
   the business. They include costs such as salaries, rent, utilities, and marketing 2.
5. Professional Services Ratio (PS Ratio): This ratio measures the efficiency and cost-
   effectiveness of the professional services team in generating revenue. It is calculated as Net
   Professional Services Revenue divided by Professional Services Costs 3.
6. Sales and Marketing Ratio (S&M Ratio): This ratio measures how efficiently the sales and
   marketing team is bringing in new business. It is calculated as 70% of Net License & Hardware
   Revenue divided by Sales & Marketing Costs 4.
7. Maintenance Ratio: This ratio measures the profitability of maintenance revenue streams. It is
   calculated as 85% of Net Maintenance/Warranty Revenue divided by Maintenance Costs 5.
8. Research and Development Ratio (R&D Ratio): This ratio measures the cost recovery of R&D
   investments. It is calculated as 30% of Net License & Hardware Revenue plus 15% of Net
   Maintenance Revenue divided by R&D Costs 6.
9. General and Administrative Ratio (G&A Ratio): This ratio measures the efficiency of general
   and administrative expenses. It is calculated as Total General & Admin Costs divided by Total
   Net Revenue 7.
   These metrics provide a comprehensive view of business performance from different
   perspectives, helping managers make informed decisions and improve overall efficiency.



   The Professional Services Ratio (PS Ratio) is a key metric used to measure the efficiency and
   cost-effectiveness of the professional services team in generating revenue. It is calculated as:

   $$\text{PS Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Professional Services Revenue}}{\text{Professional Services
   Costs}}$$

   To understand this ratio, it's important to consider the main drivers:

       1. Pricing: The rates charged for professional services.
       2. Productivity: The efficiency and effectiveness of the professional services team in
           delivering services.
       3. Cost: The expenses incurred in providing professional services, including salaries,
           benefits, and other related costs 1.
A higher PS Ratio indicates that the professional services team is generating more revenue
relative to their costs, which is a sign of efficiency and profitability.



A good Professional Services Ratio (PS Ratio) is typically considered to be greater than 2. This
means that the net professional services revenue should be at least twice the professional
services costs. For example, if a business has net professional services revenue of $200,000 and
professional services costs of $100,000, the PS Ratio would be:
$$\text{PS Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Professional Services Revenue}}{\text{Professional Services
Costs}} = \frac{200,000}{100,000} = 2$$
This indicates that the professional services team is generating revenue efficiently relative to
their costs, which is a sign of good performance 1.



The Sales and Marketing Ratio (S&M Ratio) measures how efficiently and cost-effectively the
sales and marketing team is bringing in new business. It is calculated as:
$$\text{S&M Ratio} = \frac{70% \text{ of Net License & Hardware Revenue}}{\text{Sales &
Marketing Costs}}$$

This ratio is important because new license revenue is a precursor for future maintenance
revenue. A higher S&M Ratio indicates that the sales and marketing team is generating more
revenue relative to their costs, which is a sign of efficiency and profitability 1.



The Maintenance Ratio (or Customer Support ratio) is a key metric that measures the
profitability of maintenance revenue streams. It is calculated as:
$$\text{Maintenance Ratio} = \frac{85% \text{ of Net Maintenance/Warranty
Revenue}}{\text{Maintenance Costs}}$$
Maintenance revenue is considered the most profitable revenue stream for the business. The
primary revenue risk associated with maintenance is customer attrition. Recurring maintenance
leads to stable revenue streams. Some best practices to optimize the Maintenance Ratio include
increasing prices annually (by at least CPI) and never discounting maintenance 1.

The Research and Development Ratio (R&D Ratio) is a key metric used to measure the cost
recovery of R&D investments. It is calculated as:
$$\text{R&D Ratio} = \frac{(30% \text{ of Net License & Hardware Revenue}) + (15% \text{ of
Net Maintenance Revenue})}{\text{R&D Costs}}$$

This ratio is intended to give you the ability to measure R&D as an ongoing investment versus
solely as a cost. It looks at R&D in a cost recovery manner, meaning that anything less than 1
indicates that the business is losing money in R&D and not recovering its costs 1.

Would you like to know more about any other financial metrics or concepts?
Certainly! The General and Administrative Ratio (G&A Ratio) is a key metric used to measure
the efficiency of general and administrative expenses. It is calculated as:

$$\text{G&A Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total General & Admin Costs}}{\text{Total Net Revenue}}$$

This ratio helps to understand how much of the total net revenue is being spent on general and
administrative costs. A lower G&A Ratio indicates that the business is managing its
administrative expenses efficiently relative to its revenue 1.


A good General and Administrative Ratio (G&A Ratio) is typically considered to be less than
15%. This means that the total general and administrative costs should be less than 15% of the
total net revenue 1. A lower G&A Ratio indicates that the business is managing its administrative
expenses efficiently relative to its revenue.
