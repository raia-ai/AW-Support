          Automation for sales documents
          The system offers extensive technical support for the processing of quotations
          and orders.
          •   Entered elements are displayed true to scale and represented graphically
              in order to prevent errors during input and to accelerate the entire process.
          •   The price calculation is very flexible and allows division into standard prices
              and customer-specific terms. The calculation is controlled across the sys-
              tem, but it can also be adjusted manually.
          •   Delivery notes and invoices are generated from the order data using con-
              figurable settings.

          Data security
          The application is transaction-secure. This means that the program executes
          actions completely, e.g. when invoices are generated. If this is not possible,
          the action started will be canceled completely. This means that the database
          cannot be filled with errors or data fragments. Even in case of a system crash,
          the components used allow a near-complete and consistent restoration of the
          data. Backups will be made automatically at a defined, or during operation.

                       Quotations
                       Your customers requests alternative quotations for various IG items in the
                       quotation. For this purpose, certain float sheets shall be replaced by e. g. ther-
                       mally insulated glass or, as an option, by LAMI. In addition, in case of a LAMI
                       replacement, the AIR shall be modified.
                       This is no problem at all with A+W Business. The following options are avail-
                       able :
                       •   Create an alternative quotation for the entire quotation.
                       •   Create an alternative quotation for only a few items.
                       •   Replace all glasses and AIRs.
                       •   Add shapes, grills and processing to items, delete them from existing items

                              can be transferred to production only if it has got the appropriate status.
                              The current state of production is reported back to A+W Business. Based on
                              this, the status of each order item is changed, and finally that of the entire or-
                              der. Depending on how a company is organized, the status is raised automat-
                              ically or manually. The data including the change of status can be entered via
                              barcodes, which helps to reduce input errors considerably.

                          For PGR combinations 101 and 814, 1G< is 1G1. This means that the analy-
                          sis of the combination is part of PGR 1G1.
                          The other examples are constructed in the same way.
                          This rule can also be applied to the second and even the first digit. This will
                          result in a large number of combinations and is therefore prone to errors.
                          It is essential to define all product groups that can be created by a PGR com-
                          bination. For the first example, these are PGR 1G0 to 1G9.

                         to undesired results.

                          You do not need to correct price differences manually. You can just accept
                          the document despite these differences. The program will make the neces-
                          sary corrections automatically.
                      7 When all errors have been corrected, select the option Accept.
                      8 Go to the menu Start > Save to close the invoice control.
