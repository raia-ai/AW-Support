              in order to prevent errors during input and to accelerate the entire process.
          •   The price calculation is very flexible and allows division into standard prices
              and customer-specific terms. The calculation is controlled across the sys-
              tem, but it can also be adjusted manually.
          •   Delivery notes and invoices are generated from the order data using con-
              figurable settings.

## Tip 12


                                                                                                           Basic version - Sales

## Tip 13


                        BOM elements can be individual products as well as processing steps or fur-
                        ther bills of material, so-called assemblies. All BOM components have to be
                        entered as products in master data.
                        The BOM breakdown options are unlimited: Multiple IG, multiple LAMI or TG
                        can be kept in BOM format. With A+W Business, it is even possible to consider
                        different conditions for price calculation for each component of a BOM.

## Tip 14



                       Automatic price calculation
                       Apart from a convenient maintenance of the price data, automatic calculation
                       of the prices is important. Regardless of whether the focus is on standard or
                       individual prices or surcharges on top of the base price: all details for the cal-
                       culation of the items are pulled in automatically. Of course in the quotation or
                       order you can override each price manually without writing the data back to the
                       price tables.

## Tip 15

                        If the necessary data has been entered in the order, the items must be pro-
                        duced, packed and sent. It may be necessary to purchase additional articles
                        for production which are not kept on stock. The order triggers other business
                        transactions which are automated as much as possible:
                        •   Printing of other documents, e. g. order confirmation, delivery note, invoice
                        •   Purchase order issued by purchasing
                        •   Withdrawal of stock articles for production
                        •   Transfer of order data to production
                        •   Report from production once the order has been produced and is ready to

## Tip 16


                          OTR takes several trucks into account and analyzes driving times in order to
                          ensure that deliveries or pick-ups are within the planned schedules. The
                          routes are adjusted to the traffic in order to obtain the best result.
                          When calculating the ideal route, important parameters, e. g. storage space,
                          business arrangements, delivery times, standing times or priorities, are taken
                          into consideration. The optimization process generates orders with which des-
                          tinations with a high priority status can be delivered first.

## Tip 17




                         Statistics and reports
                         For the success of your company, it is important to check current results and
                         make the right decisions. The data from the documents must be reproduced
                         in meaningful presentations. And the most important key figures must be cre-
                         ated based on your information.

                       •   Transfer to production:
                           Order items to be produced are transferred to production.
                           The required materials are reserved and are booked out of stock when the
                           delivery note or invoice is printed. At the same time, the available stock on
                           hand is updated.

## Tip 22

                      The tutorial on module Master data deals with the basic and master data in
                      A+W Business.

                           The functions depend on the released modules
                           Please note that the individual functions are available only if the corre-
                           sponding modules and interfaces have been installed and released.

                           If you detect functions in this description which are not available in your ver-

## Tip 24

                      When the essential order data have been entered, the item have to be pro-
                      duced, packed, and shipped. It may be necessary to purchase additional arti-
                      cles for production which are not kept on stock. The order triggers other
                      business transactions which are automated as much as possible:
                      •    Printing of other documents, e. g. order confirmation, delivery note, invoice
                      •    Purchase order issued by purchasing

## Tip 25

                      entered yet.
                      In customer management you can enter many basic data directly, based on
                      the current requirements for customer master data.

                           Note
                           Whenever you enter or change basic data or master data you should test
                           them first. This way you can see - before actually using the new data -
                           whether the result meets your expectations.

                      quotations, P for production, D for delivery note. Text codes can be entered
                      according to your company's requirements.

                       A price table must not be entered as a triangle if the direction in which the
                       glass is cut is important. If height and width of patterned glass must not be

## Tip 73

             • Group surcharges refer to glass types united in price groups. The surcharge for
               exchanging a lite therefore does not have to be defined per glass (product).


             Note

             Price groups                Price groups collect products in groups for which no

## Tip 75

                      • The processing of shapes means additional work which usually has to be

                      Note

                      Processing surcharge       For the additional work in connection with the
                                                 processing of shapes, a surcharge is defined which is
                                                 based on the processing step and on the shape.

## Tip 76

             • Energy surcharge-, transport/toll-, spacer-, small/oversize-, minimum quantity-,
               thickness surcharges are defined as miscellaneous surcharges.


             Note

                      • Discounts reduce the list price of products when items are calculated in a
                        document and are therefore an important tool for pricing.
                      • As discounts can be allocated quite specifically, pricing can be customised to a
                        very high degree.

## Tip 84

                Copy discounts
                If discounts have been entered already, you can copy and edit them for new
                customers or suppliers. In these new discounts, individual values can be
                changed or can be generally reduced or increased by a certain amount or
                percentage. This way, new discounts are easy to define. Please note that
                price year, price key, and rate for the target discount have to be entered be-

## Tip 97


            Document type                 Not every status can be applied to every document,
                                          e. g. all documents have the status Document entered
                                          at one time or another but a quotation can never reach
                                          the status Delivery note printed.

            Not every status can be applied to every document, e. g. all documents have
            the status Document entered at one time or another but a quotation can never
            reach the status Delivery note printed.
            The following document types are available:
            •   0 = all documents
            •   1 = quotations
            •   2 = order
