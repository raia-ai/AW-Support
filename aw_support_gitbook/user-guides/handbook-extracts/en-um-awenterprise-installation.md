          This comprehensive system includes the sections sales management, sales
          support, purchasing management, inventory management, and dispatch plan-
          ning.
          A+W Enterprise consists of three architectural levels: Presentation, applica-
          tion logic, and database. These can be installed and operated on different
          computers. This increases the scalability and fail-safe nature of the system.
          The application is based on a relational database and is available as a LINUX-
          , UNIX- version. The user front end is available on MS Windows.
          A+W Enterprise can be used throughout the glass industry, by typical retailers,
          IG, tempered and laminated glass producers, as well as groups of companies

                         Note

                         Scalability                  Thanks to its modular structure and system
                                                      architecture, A+W Enterprise can be adapted to
                                                      individual requirements. This way, A+W Enterprise can
                                                      be adjusted to the performance and the complexity of
                                                      the system.

                      Note

                      System environment        The Unix-based A+W Enterprise offers a graphic user
                                                interface (MS Windows); thanks to its client server
                                                architecture (3-tier model) it can be adapted step by
                                                step to individual business requirements, and can be
                                                extended anytime.

                      Adaptation - modular structure
                      Modern software packages come with a solid system architecture and well-
                      founded, specialist knowledge.
                      A+W Enterprise can be adapted flexibly. This means that A+W Enterprise can
                      be adapted to the individual requirements and the size of the business. Thanks
                      to the modular system structure, certain modules can be added later on in the
                      project.
                      The business structures and processes of glass merchants, IG, tempered, and
                      laminated glass producers as well as groups of companies are optimally sup-
                      ported.

```

## Installation Step 11

```

                         System architecture
                         A+W Enterprise is based on the operating system Unix and can be run on AIX
                         or Linux servers.
                         Thanks to the clear separation of database, application, and surface (3-tier ar-
                         chitecture), the system can be flexibly adapted to the individual requirements.
                         With a growing number of users, you can increase the performance without
                         having to change databases and surface (user PCs).
                         The relational database INFORMIX is used for storage purposes. The under-
                         lying data structure is open and accessible via online documentation. Data can
                         be analyzed anytime by means of standard software. Microsoft Word or Excel
```

## Installation Step 12

```
                         Since the operating interface is run on a separate Windows application (FIX/
                         Win) while A+W Enterprise itself is run on an application server, the system
                         does not require a high-performance terminal PC.

                         Maintenance and service
                         Every A+W Enterprise installation includes a comprehensive service concept.
                         Service includes regular updates dispatched via network which are installed
                         outside regular operating hours. Maintenance is generally done via network
                         link so that data can be transferred at the same time. This is a very effective
                         means of support.

                      Benefits of A+W Enterprise as com-
                      pared with A+W Business
                      A+W Software GmbH offers two commercial software systems: A+W Enter-
                      prise and A+W Business. Both systems are tailored to the needs of the flat
                      glass industry and its commercial and administrative requirements.
                      Whether A+W Business or A+W Enterprise is the right solution, mainly de-
                      pends on the size and structure of the individual company.
                      Large companies with quite a lot of subsidiaries will usually profit from the ar-
                      chitecture of the A+W Enterprise system. For individual companies or small

                      on hand. Using the minimum and alarm stock, the inventory module automat-
                      ically issues PO suggestions for purchasing, based on the physical and avail-
                      able stock.

                      Inventory
                      We recommend permanent stocktaking to fulfil the requirements of the annual
                      inventory. Permanent stocktaking allows to determine at a given date the the
                      stock on hand by type, quantity, value, without having to count every single
                      item. At least once per business year, it needs to be checked whether the
                      quantities booked in A+W Enterprise match the actual stock. Stocktaking can
                      thus be done e.g. at a time when the stock is low.

                       With the factor (C), you can specify whether the price should be reduced or in-
                       creased. A factor of 100% calculates the specified price. If you want to reduce
                       prices, you can simply reduce the factor. Thus, all price levels are multiplied
                       by the factor.
