                        Distinguishing A+W Business from A+W Enterprise
                        A+W Software GmbH offers two commercial software solutions: A+W Busi-
                        ness and A+W Enterprise. Both systems fulfil the requirements of the flat glass
                        industry in the commercial/administrative sector. Their deployment depends
                        on the company size and structure:
                        •   A+W Business is designed for individual companies or company groups
                            acting like individual companies.
                            The system is based on a modern Windows-based 2-layer architecture on

## Installation Step 2

```
                        A+W Business is a multi-dialog application:
                        •   Several dialogs, e g. quotation, order and master data dialogs, can be
                            opened and edited at the same time.
                        •   The dialogs can be positioned where desired and can be scaled steplessly.
                        •   With an editor, documents and reports can be easily and quickly formatted
                            and adjusted to the requirements of your company.

                        System environment
                        In order to fulfill the basic requirements of a high-performance IT system, spe-
                        cial attention was paid to the following areas:
                        •   Operational security
                        •   System availability
                        •   Supported hardware platforms
                        •   Extensibility

                        •   Extensibility
                        •   Networking options
                        •   Access restriction and control
                        Due to its client-server architecture, A+W Business can be adapted and ex-
                        panded to operational requirements step by step.

## Installation Step 5

```
                        System architecture
                        A+W Business builds on Windows operating systems and is operated on mod-
                        ern Microsoft server-client systems.
                        Thanks to the clear separation of data storage, data processing, and interface
                        in the 2-layer architecture, the system can be adjusted very flexibly to opera-
                        tional requirements. This ensures that with a growing number of users, more
                        computer power can be incorporated into the application layer without having
                        to change the databases and settings on the user PCs.
                        For data storage, the relational database MS SQL Server is used. The under-
                        lying data model can be viewed in the online documentation. This serves in
                        particular the extensibility and the option to create reports and statistical re-

                      The tutorial on module Master data deals with the basic and master data in
                      A+W Business.

                           The functions depend on the released modules
                           Please note that the individual functions are available only if the corre-
                           sponding modules and interfaces have been installed and released.

                           If you detect functions in this description which are not available in your ver-

                      a simple order using the master data for partners, products, and prices.
                      Tutorial 2 also describes further settings for the internal processes in
                      A+W Business.

                           Technical requirements
                           Training and self-studies require a full A+W Business version including the
                           appropriate database.

                           Technical requirements
                           Training and self-studies require a full A+W Business version including the
                           appropriate database.


                      Target Group and Prerequisite Knowledge
                      Tutorial 1 and 2 are meant for users entering and maintaining master data in
                      A+W Business. They have to be familiar with the specific terminology of the
                      flat glass industry, and have to have basic knowledge of commercial process-
                      es.
                      Participants have to be familiar with the user interface and the general opera-

## Installation Step 14

```
                      Master Data Input
                      When you enter master data from scratch you should stick to the following rec-
                      ommendation. It prevents you from having to access data that have not been
                      entered yet.
                      In customer management you can enter many basic data directly, based on
                      the current requirements for customer master data.

                           Note
                           Whenever you enter or change basic data or master data you should test
                           them first. This way you can see - before actually using the new data -
                           whether the result meets your expectations.

                      Text and Text Codes
                      Recurring text can be saved, e.g. to be included in the document automatical-
                      ly. We distinguish system-, default-, and spacer text.
                      Standard text is distinguished by means of text codes, e. g. text code Q for
                      quotations, P for production, D for delivery note. Text codes can be entered
                      according to your company's requirements.

                           Examples

                      the recipient will be able to read them.

                           Example

                           Emailing a PDF file requires that the recipient has installed a so-called viewer
                           that allows to open and read the document, e.g. Acrobat Reader. This
                           document format is best suited if you want to include shape sketches or grills
                           in the document.
