long_description: "This is a detailed chapter from the A+W Enterprise software reference manual, specifically covering the 'Preisschlüssel' (Price Keys) and various pricing methodologies. The document guides users through the setup of master data related to pricing. Key topics include creating 'Bearbeitungsvektoren' (processing vectors) for quantity-scaled processing prices, 'Sprossenpreiskennzeichen' (mullion price identifiers) for managing prices in different currencies or from various price lists, and 'Sprossenpreisklassen' (mullion price classes). It introduces the main 'Preise' (Prices) chapter, which deals with global price maintenance, article prices, and matrices. The guide provides detailed instructions on 'Globale Preispflege' (Global Price Maintenance) for copying and adjusting price lists. A significant portion is dedicated to 'ISO-Preise', covering the setup of base prices, single pane prices, and the use of the 'Matrix-Editor' for complex price structures based on dimensions or quantities. It also explains the setup of 'PKZ-Preise', an alternative pricing method, detailing article vectors, processing vectors, VSG prices, and variant pricing. The document includes screenshots of the user interface, descriptions of each field, and technical information such as database field names, making it an essential resource for administrators and power users responsible for configuring and maintaining the pricing system in A+W Enterprise."
