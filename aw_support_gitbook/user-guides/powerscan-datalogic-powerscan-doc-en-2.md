# POWERSCAN™ PD9531

---
## AIM, TRIGGER, DECODE: IT'S THAT SIMPLE!
An intuitive and effortless scanning experience is the target of the PowerScan™ 9501 family. It combines omnidirectional reading capabilities, which is typical in all area imaging scanners, with outstanding optical characteristics. The result is a scanner that is able to read any kind of bar code, regardless of the orientation, from contact to over 1.0 m / 3.3 ft, depending on the bar code resolution. In addition, the PowerScan PD9531 area imager includes Datalogic's latest decoding software that guarantees snappy reading in any type of environment. Aim, trigger, decode: it is that simple!

## DEVELOPED WITH THE USER IN MIND
User comfort is guaranteed because of the scanner ergonomics, consisting of the handle shape, a well-balanced weight and an intuitive aiming system, allowing the highest first-pass reading rate while reducing unnatural wrist movement or rotation which can tire any user during long shifts. Additionally, the PowerScan 9501 family uses a soft-pulsed white illumination light resulting in reduced flashes, which is very gentle on the eyes and less troublesome to the operator during scan-intensive applications.

## BUILT TO LAST
The rugged mechanics of the PowerScan family guarantee reliable operation in the long term. Repeated shocks and indoor / outdoor usage in the toughest environmental conditions do not modify the scanners performance or reliability.
