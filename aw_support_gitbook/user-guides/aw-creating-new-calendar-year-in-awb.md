# A+W Creating new calendar year in AWB

Setting up a calendar for the new year in A+W Business
The calendars in A+W Business (AWB) is setup in the master data and can be located under [Master
Data \ General \ Calendar].




When in you have entered the master data for the calendar you need to create a new calendar. This is
done by clicking the [New] button at the top of the page.
Enter data for the normal working week of the users that work with AWB, standard is 8 hours Then select
the weekdays that you want to apply the selected hours to, normally Monday – Friday.




When this is done go to the “Selection field” and enter the year that you want to create the calendar for, in
this case I want to create it for the year 2017.

You can now click [Save], this will create you calendar in the database.
Changes for specific weeks
If you need to make changes to the working hours for example if factory is closed during summer
vacation then you can choose to apply the settings for just one week. In my example I want to change the
calendar so that it shows that we are not working during the Christmas holidays. I would then mark the
days that I want to apply changes to, set the hours = 0, select the year (2016) and week (52). You can
then press the button [Apply to week]. You will then see the proposed changes in the table to the right.
When you are satisfied with your changes you press [Save] to write the modifications to the database.
