# A+W BUSINESS – SETTING UP A MINIMUM INVOICE AMOUNT

> More Information - [AW-214264]

## Customer Account Setup
On a customer record on the 2. Order tab change the Invoicing surcharge / minimum value.
Notice the mode in the image below and have the value as before GST.

- Mode = Min Value (in one item)
- Value = 36.37 (before GST)

## Order Entry
In this instance the system will add a new entry on the order which calculate the shortfall in the order amount.
See red amount in the image below.

## Invoice Example
Finally we can see a print out of the invoice showing a Surcharge for bill of 12.88.
Adding this to the order item amount of 23.49 we have a total of 36.37.
The total of 36.37 was the previous value that was entered against the previous customer setup.
