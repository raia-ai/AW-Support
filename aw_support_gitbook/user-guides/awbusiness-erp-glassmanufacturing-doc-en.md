## Basic Ideas on Production and Dispatch

Orders have been entered in document management, the items of which have to be produced. The orders and order items have to be transferred to production for this purpose. The data which are relevant for production are saved in a file which can be imported by the production software.

By means of the ERP Webservice, these transfer files can be directly passed on to the production software *A+W Production* to be imported.

*Fig. E-2 Transfer to production and dispatch organization*

This sketch shows you the interaction of the transfer of orders to Production, reports from Production, and the organization of dispatch.

The order status controls the correct booking sequence so that an order can only be transferred to production if it has the appropriate status, for example. The current state of production is reported back to *A+W Business*. Based on this, the status of each order item is changed, and finally that of the entire order. Depending on how a company is organized, the status is raised automatically or manually. The data including the change of status can be entered via barcodes, which helps to reduce input errors considerably.

Based on capacity checks, production and delivery dates can be examined and amended if necessary so that dispatch can be optimally organized.

Route and loading lists are created for dispatch, allowing the vehicles to be loaded optimally based on route and the weight permitted.

### Procedures in production and dispatch
The sequence of the individual actions for production and dispatch of an order depends on the conditions in your company.

The process can be organized like this, for example:
*   Transfer to Production
*   Check report from Production
*   Print delivery notes
*   Route planning
*   Print loading list and receipt acknowledgement list
*   Shipment

## Transfer to Production
This session shows you how to transfer orders or quotations to Production.
This includes the following training modules:
*   "Transfer to Production - Variations" on page E-19
*   "Transfer to Production without Capacity Planning" on page E-27
*   "Transfer to Production by A+W Business Capacity Planning" on page E-41
*   "Transfer to Production by A+W Production Capacity Planner" on page E-45
*   "Transfer to Quotation Optimization" on page E-50

### Transfer to Production – Variations
Order data are transferred to *A+W Production* or another production program when they have reached the defined minimum status. The data can be transferred in the following ways:
*   Without capacity planning: The orders are directly transferred to Production without entering them in capacity planning first.
*   With *A+W Business* Capacity Planning
*   With *A+W Production* Capacity Planner

In the last two cases, the orders will pass through the following steps:
- First, the orders are transferred to capacity planning.
- The status of the order is raised after the production and delivery dates have been confirmed or amended.
- Machine capacities are reserved now.
- After that, the orders are transferred to production and can be produced.

The individual processes will be introduced in separate training sessions.

#### Data transfer
Your order data will be passed on for further processing to *A+W Production* for production or to *A+W Standard Optimizer* for cutting optimization. This only works if the product and article numbers in *A+W Business* and *A+W Production* have been allocated. For other programs, you can define an appropriate allocation key in *Product management > Production* tab in field *Optimization key*.

For the production of toughened glass, laminated glass, cast resin, etc., the product will be broken down to bill of material level for *A+W Production*. The production start is reported to *A+W Business* on unit level. Depending on the setting, the order status can be raised now. These settings will be introduced in the session on Reports.
⇨ "Reports from Production" on page E-56

Orders can be transferred in different ways, no matter whether capacities are scheduled first:
*   **Manual transfer to Production**
    Manual transfer of orders is done by means of the *Transfer to Production* dialog, where you can transfer all orders of a Number Manager with a status that is equal to or higher than the Production release status and lower than the status scheduled in detail.
*   **Automatic transfer to Production via workflow task**
    A workflow task with an appropriate interval is defined for automatic transfer so that the program will regularly search for orders to be transferred to Capacity Planning or Production. This workflow task will be explained in a separate chapter.
    ⇨ "Transfer to Production via Workflow Task" on page E-24

#### OrderXML
The OrderXML format is based on the standardized Open Trans interface, with specific extensions for production-relevant data such as glass, Georgian bars, or processing.

The production software recognizes the format as that of an order. A separate file will be created for every order that is transferred to Production. The location for the transfer file must be defined in *A+W Business* and *A+W Production*.

#### Status check
Status points have to be completely defined and allocated for both manual and automatic transfer to Production. The system uses these status allocations for checking whether the order data can be transferred.

The allocations were adapted to your business and implemented before the installation of *A+W Business*. The basics on status points and allocations have already been introduced in the training sessions on master data and sales. This is why we are not going to spend any more time on this subject here.

#### Cancellation
Every order can be canceled up to a certain point. This point must be defined internally.

When transfer to Production is canceled, the transferred order will be transferred to Production again. A cancellation code is set which tells the user on the shop floor that this order has been canceled.

#### Special case: optimization of quotations
Quotations can be transferred to Production just to calculate the cutting yield. This function is available if one of the following versions of transfer to Production is used:
*   No capacity planning
*   A+W Business Capacity Planning

The function is blocked if transfer to Production is activated by offers via workflow task.

The transfer of quotations for optimization purposes is explained in detail in a separate training session.
⇨ "Transfer to Quotation Optimization" on page E-50

### Schematic Processes of the Versions
This section provides different production transfer processes schematically. The illustrations in connection with capacity planning are built upon one another so that the steps described above can be summed up.

The processes are meant as examples. The transfer process may be organized quite differently in your company.

#### Schematic process without capacity planning
*   Order entered
*   Production release (Status point 35)
*   Transfer to Production (Status point 40)
*   Scheduling in *A+W Production* (internal production release processes)
*   Production reports
*   (Alternative path: Order canceled, Status point 810)

The minimum and lock status will be checked for transfer to production. Orders that do not meet these requirements cannot be transferred.

#### Schematic process with capacity planning
*   Order entered
*   Production release? (Yes/No)
    *   No -> Change status
    *   Yes -> Capacity planning
*   Scheduling successful? (Yes/No)
    *   No -> Changing dates
    *   Yes -> Print order confirmation
*   Production release
*   Transfer to Production
*   Scheduling in *A+W Production* (internal production release processes)
*   Transfer to Production
*   Production reports

#### Schematic process including purchase order and item amendment
*   Order entered
*   Capacity planning
*   Print order confirmation
*   Ordered elements received? (Yes/No)
    *   Yes -> Issue P.O. -> Wait for delivery of goods -> (back to 'Ordered elements received?')
    *   No -> Production release
*   Transfer to Production
*   Item changed? (Yes/No)
    *   Yes -> (Loops back to before 'Ordered elements received?')
    *   No -> Production
*   Production reports

After successful scheduling, capacity planning reports the time costs and the production date.

### Changing transferred Items
When an order that has been transferred to production, its status is 40. If such an order is changed, there are two possible scenarios:
*   Changes in prices, discounts, etc. which are irrelevant for production will not change the status, nor does the order have to be transferred again.
*   When quantities, sizes, glass types, or similar details are changed, the order gets a special code and is immediately transferred to Production by means of a workflow task.

Company organization must define what is going to happen with items that have already been produced. You can, for example, define that an order item has to be canceled and created again.

### Transfer of Orders with Purchase Orders
If you produce IG with toughened lites, for example, but do not manufacture the toughened sheets yourself, the production process depends on the delivery of the toughened sheets. After booking the receipt of goods, data can be automatically transferred to *A+W Production*. If the goods received include such toughened lites, the start of production is triggered for the corresponding IG units.

Automatic transfer of goods received is linked with the receipt of goods in Purchasing.

### Transfer to Production via Workflow Task
A workflow task serves to process orders automatically whenever possible. If and to what extent manual intervention is required between two consecutive workflow tasks depends on the organization of processes in your company. The necessary settings are defined at installation and should not be changed afterwards. This chapter therefore only deals with the schematic processes.

Every workflow task consists of one or more customizing formulas. In these formulas, the individual actions are defined that should be performed. *A+W Business Interface Service (AIS)* executes the tasks either periodically or at a fixed time.

#### Settings for the workflow task
Three steps are necessary for defining a workflow task:
*   Enter the formula for automatic transfer to Production in *Master Data > Company > Formulas*.
*   Allocate the formula to a workflow task in *Master Data > Company > Customizing > Workflow tasks* tab.
*   Set the workflow task in *Master Data > Company > Customizing > Autom. process execution* tab.

Please ask a member of the A+W Software GmbH service team for support when you change the transfer to Production to workflow task.

This section shows the settings using an example which may differ from the settings at your company.

**How to check the settings for the workflow task**
1.  Go to the *Master Data* menu > *Company > Customizing* then proceed to the *Workflow tasks* tab.

    *Fig. E-3 Example: Workflow tasks*

    This tab shows the workflow tasks defined for *A+W Business* and the allocated formulas.
2.  Select the workflow task you want to edit.
3.  Go to the tab *Autom. process execution*.
