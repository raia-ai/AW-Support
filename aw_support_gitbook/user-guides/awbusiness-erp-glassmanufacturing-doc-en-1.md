It covers setting up transfers, handling report files, and configuring system settings for both file-based and file-less reporting."
long_description: "This comprehensive tutorial guides users through advanced functionalities of the A+W Business Production software, focusing on two key areas: the optimization of quotations via production transfer and the management of production reports. The first section explains how to transfer quotations, particularly for rarely used glass types, to the production module. This allows for a pre-calculation of cutting processes to determine required glass and waste, ensuring accurate sales pricing. It details the setup for quotation transfers, including default settings and the manual transfer process. The second major section introduces production reports, which provide crucial information on production progress and update the status of items and orders. It describes two methods for receiving reports: file-based reports generated by A+W Production and imported by the A+W Business Interface Service (AIS), and file-less reports that load data online from A+W Production via an ERP web service. The document provides step-by-step instructions on defining registration points, allocating status points, configuring company data and interface settings for both reporting methods, and checking the status of items and orders. It concludes with detailed examples illustrating how file-less reports provide a real-time view of production progress."

# Tutorial: Transfer to Production

---
## Optimization of Quotations

If you have entered rarely used glass types in a quotation, it is essential to make sure that the sales price is calculated so as to avoid losses. You can transfer the quotation to Production in order to plan the cutting process and thus determine the glass required as well as the waste.

Quotations with a quotation code will be transferred to Production. The items of the quotation will not be produced.

There will be no feedback on quotations. After optimization, you will have to ask the person in charge on the shop floor how many stock plates were actually cut. This information will help you to calculate the sales price for your quotation or for the ensuing order.

> **i Transfer via workflow task**
> The offers are generally transferred through an own workflow task. This form of transfer does not differ from the transfer of the orders.
> ⇨ "Transfer to Production via Workflow Task" on page E-24

## Set up Transfer of Quotations

Transfer of quotations to optimization is set up in the same way as the transfer of orders to Production. The procedure has been introduced in connection with the transfer of orders to Production.

In case of OrderXML transfer you can define the transfer of quotations in the same way as for orders. The transfer includes a code that helps to distinguish quotations and orders.

> **i General settings**
> Most of the settings for the optimization of quotations are the same as for the transfer of orders. This instruction only describes the settings which apply to quotations.
> ⇨ "How to check the defaults for the transfer to Production" on page E-31

### How to check the default settings for the optimization of quotations

1.  Go to the **Company data** dialog > **Production** tab and click on **[Quotation settings]**.

    *   **Fig. E-17: Optimization of quotations**
        *A screenshot shows the "Settings - Transfer into Production" dialog. The image highlights the 'Transfer Mode' section.*

2.  Check the settings as described in chapter *Manual transfer to Production*.

3.  Please make sure that the option **acc. to min. and lock status prod. transfer (A)** is set in section **Transfer mode**.

4.  If you are going to transfer the quotations to capacity planning too, the corresponding capacities will be reserved but the items will not be produced afterwards. This would only block machinery time which is needed for production.

5.  Click on **[OK]** to save the data.
    The data is saved.

## Transfer of Quotations to Production

This chapter tells you how to transfer a quotation manually to Production to be optimized. Cutting will be optimized without actually producing the items.

The procedure for transferring quotations is the same as for transferring orders.

### How to manually transfer quotations to optimization

1.  Go to menu **Production > Production > Quotation optimization > Transfer to Production**.

    *   **Fig. E-18: Transfer to Production – Start quotation transfer**
        *A screenshot of the "Transferring 6 quotations" dialog is shown. It displays a list of quotations ready for transfer.*
        *   **A**: Number Manager with offers
        *   **B**: Cost calculation mode

2.  Select the **Number Manager (A)** to which the quotation to be optimized has been moved.

3.  Check if **cost calculation mode (B)** is selected.

4.  To start the transmission, go to the menu **Start > Execute**.

    Section **Output** shows the quotation item that is currently being processed. The data will be saved as a file in the directory you have defined in the **Settings for transfer to Production** dialog.

    If you have transferred more than one quotation, a message will inform you of the number of quotations that have not been transferred.

    An OrderXML file will be created for every quotation. The file name is completed with the quotation number and a time stamp. At transfer to AWPool, all data will be saved in a single file.

    The status of the transferred orders changes.

    After optimization you will have to ask the person in charge on the shop floor how many stock plates were actually cut.

## Exercises

*   Create a Number Manager in which you collect quotations to be transferred to production.
*   Create a number of different quotations.
*   Transfer the quotations.

# Reports from Production

This chapter introduces the reports from Production. You will learn how to set up A+W Business so that you can receive these reports.

This includes the following training modules:
*   "Production Reports via Files" on page E-57
*   "File-less Production Report" on page E-68
*   "A+W Business Interface Service” on page E-77

## Production reports

Production reports in A+W Business serve to provide information on the production progress. The reports update the status of items and orders.

Reports can be created and read in the following ways:
*   **Report file:**
    Report files are created by A+W Production and imported by the A+W Business Interface Service (AIS). This program runs centrally on the server and checks the defined directories periodically for new items.
*   **File-less report:**
    A+W Business loads the data online from A+W Production. This online query is precise with regard to time and quantities and reflects the exact state of production of an order.

## Production Reports via Files

### Objectives
*   Introducing report files
*   Basic understanding of shop floor data collection
*   Defining registration points for production reports from A+W Production
*   Defining the transfer paths for the report files

### Benefits
*   Registration points permit the monitoring of the production progress and thus check the actual state of an order or of order items.
*   Overviews of the status of items and orders can be displayed by registration point.
*   Shipping papers can be printed without delay.

**Please note:**

*   **Registration point**: A registration point (RP) is a place on the shop floor where a production step is registered, e.g. the cutting of the first lite of an order. In A+W Business, a status point is allocated to the RP so that the status of an order will be changed by the report from the corresponding RP.
*   **Shop floor data collection**: Shop floor data collection in A+W Production monitors the production of every single order on the shop floor.
*   **Report from A+W Production**: Report files from A+W Production are moved to a server and are analyzed by A+W Business.
*   **File import interval**: The report files are imported by the A+W Business Interface Service (AIS). You can define the interval.
*   **Default settings**:
    *   Master data:
        *   Registration points - Production
        *   Interface service
    *   Company data:
        *   Stock/PP/EDI tab
        *   Production tab

## Report Files

In A+W Production, data are collected from all vital registration points (RP) on the shop floor, and are passed on as report files. These production reports serve for monitoring the production progress in A+W Business. This allows you to check the actual status of an order.

These files can be sent in two different formats:
*   STS*.ASC files from registration points
*   AWB_STAT files from shop floor data collection

In addition to the registration points in A+W Business, more registration points can be agreed and defined in A+W Production, e.g. machine allocations. These are usually reported by STSD file to A+W Business. The code for these registration points must be higher than 200 so that it can be processed properly.

**Tab. E-1: Examples of report files from registration points**

| A+W Production file | Report from | Action in A+W Business |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **STSP** | Production (e.g. A+W Production RP 600, 700, 800 and 900) | Reports are made mainly by piece. You can define in A+W Business whether the status should be raised with the first sheet or only after reports on all lites of an order have been made. |
| **STSL** | Planning (e.g. RP 0, 100, 150 and 200) | When a new order number has been loaded in A+W Production, the order is set in A+W Business to the status allocated to the registration point in A+W Business. If registration point 0 is reported, the status is reset to the value defined in status management. |
| **STSD** | Barcoding (e.g. for machines) | Barcode reports in A+W Business serve to update the order status, the production date, and the main or item number. Reports are made mainly by piece. You can define in A+W Business whether the status shall be raised with the first lite or only after reports on all lites of an order have been made. If a registration point is listed to which no status has been assigned, the status will be processed and changed in time management. |
| **STSG** | Rack (RP 900) | The report from registration point 900 means that the rack has been booked as 'shipped' on the defined date. |
| **STSK** | Rack. The RP can show the following values: 10: shipped, first report; 20: shipped, amendment; 40: rack on the premises. | After checking whether the rack exists, it is booked on the registration point in question. If the rack does not exist yet, it will be created. For 10 and 20, the shipping date will be updated and for 40, the date of return. The customer number will be updated anyway. |
| **STSB** | (N/A) | This report is made for complaints and breakage on the shop floor. A+W Business will turn this into complaint orders. |

If STSP, STSL, STSD, STSB, STSG are being used, a registration point assigned to a status point must be selected in company data. If no such registration point has been assigned, the report will cause an error.

Reports from detailed scheduling and from produced units are saved in A+W Business in separate database tables with the corresponding fields, e.g. by order, item, and BOM ID.

Completed items are registered via A+W Production barcodes. This information is passed on as a report to A+W Business, which results in the raising of the A+W Business item status.

## Registration Points for Reports from Production

Registration points (RP) in A+W Production monitor the state of production and send reports to A+W Business. The files are imported by A+W Business Interface Service.

In A+W Business, each registration point is allocated to a status point so that the reports change the status of the item or of the order depending on the registration point.

Production reports are expected by default from the following registration points:

| Registration point = A+W Production status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | unscheduled |
| 100 | scheduled in batch |
| 150 | detailed scheduling |
| 200 | released for production |
| 300 | being produced |
| 350 | breakage on the shop floor |
| 700 | produced |
| 800 | ready for shipment |
| 900 | delivered |

This way, A+W Business can give you an overview of the state of the produced items or orders. The information from the reports show at least the item status per item, the quantity produced, and the date. Other data are reported depending on the file type.

For orders or partial orders which have been reported complete and which are ready to be shipped, printing of shipping papers can be triggered without delay.

## Registration Point Allocation

To analyze the reports from A+W Production in A+W Business, you have to allocate a status point to every registration point, and adapt the corresponding data in the interface service. These allocations are needed for production reports and barcode reports.

This session shows you how to allocate a status point for reports from a registration point in A+W Production. The next training session will tell you how to set up the interfaces.

### How to allocate a registration point for the report per file
1. Go to menu **Master data > Production > Registration points production**.
   The dialog of that name opens.
2. Go to the menu **Start > New** to switch to the input mode.

       *A screenshot of the "Registration points production" dialog is shown. It displays fields for defining a registration point and a list of existing points.*
       *   **A**: Description
       *   **B**: Status points defined in A+W Business
       *   **C**: Number of the registration point in A+W Production
       *   **D**: Type of file sent from A+W Production
       *   **E**: Time at which the status is raised
       *   **F**: Code for RP for purchase orders

3. Enter the name **(A)** of the A+W Production registration point.
   Enter a registration point that can be used to report an order shipped, for example.
4. Choose the status point **(B)** and the type **(D)**.
   Valid entries for these columns are defined in selection lists which can be opened by clicking on the corresponding line.
5. Choose the time for raising the status **(E)**:
   *   **0 - first lite completed:** The status will be raised when the first lite of the order has been reported complete.
   *   **1 - first item completed:** The status is raised when the entire first item of the order is reported complete.
   *   **2 - all lites completed:** The status is raised when all lites of the order have been reported complete.
6. When you allocate a status point to a registration point that reports the receipt of P.O. items, you have to tick the checkbox **Purchase code (F)**.
7. Go to the menu **Start > Save** to save the data.
   The data is saved.
8. Repeat steps 2 to 7 to allocate further registration points.

If you have allocated a registration point on the shop floor, you have to enter it in the interface service in the report settings as well.
⇨ "Define Interface Settings" on page E-64

## Define Company Data Settings

You have to check the settings for the production report in company data. The URL of the ERP Webservice is valid for the transfer to Production and the production report in OrderXML format. These settings are described in detail in connection with Transfer to Production.
⇨ "How to check the settings in company data" on page E-30

### How to allocate the registration point for completion reports
1. Go to the menu **Master data > Company > Company data** and proceed to the **Stock/PP/EDI** tab.

   > If you are not receiving reports from A+W Production, go to the **Settings of further formats** tab or **Options** to check or define the settings.

2. Tick the checkboxes for the data on which you want to get reports from A+W Production, and select the directory from which A+W Business should read the report files.
   The same directories have to be entered in A+W Production to make sure that the files are saved correctly.
3. To define customized settings, select the required user in the field **Settings for (A)**.
   If the settings are to be valid for all users, please select the entry **Administrator**. If you choose this setting, you have to select the same registration point in section **Order produced at (C)** as in **Company data > Stock/PP/EDI** tab.
   If the settings are made for a certain user, you can enter a different registration point in the section **Order produced at (C)**.
   By means of the selected registration point, the reports can trigger the following (additional) actions:
   *   The production date and job number are raised in the order.
   *   For production orders, the receipt of goods on stock is booked.
4. Go to the **Settings of further formats** tab.

   *   **Fig. E-22: Interface service for further formats**

## File-less Production Report

### Objectives
*   Defining the transmission route for file-less reports from A+W Production

### Benefits
*   An order's exact production progress is loaded online from A+W Production and displayed in the dialog Status report overview.
*   The online query helps to avoid malfunctions (missing bookings, double bookings) as far as possible so that differences in the production progress between A+W Production and the view in A+W Business cannot occur.

**Please note:**

*   **Registration point**: Even for file-less reports, registration points have to be allocated in the master data in A+W Business. All necessary registration points have to be defined with type `1-Other`.
*   **Online report from A+W Production**: Reports are imported by A+W Production via ERP web service and are booked by A+W Business Interface Service.
*   **Default settings**:
    *   Master data:
        *   Registration points - Production
    *   Company data:
        *   Stock/PP/EDI tab
        *   Production tab
    *   In A+W Production, the CommonBase switch `Use WebService instead of STS*.ASC` must be active.

## Check Registration Points for file-less Reports

> **i Conversion to file-less reports**
> If you want to change A+W Business to file-less reports, the following settings have to be checked in A+W Production:

7.  Go to the menu **Start > Save** to save the data. The data is saved.

## File-less Reports and online Production Overview

A+W Production loads the ERP Webservice for saving the production reports. The ERP Webservice imports the report and saves it in the database. The saved reports are then booked by the A+W Business Interface Service. The order status is updated at the same time.

A+W Business permits monitoring the production progress by means of file-less reports. A+W Business presents the collected data in the dialog **Status report overview**.

*   **Fig. E-28: Online production overview in A+W Business**
    *A screenshot displays the "Status Message" dialog showing item details, including a column for "Open processings."*

The **Open processing steps** column shows the number of processing steps for an item. This includes all work steps, from cutting to packing.

The online query is precise with regard to time and quantities, so that unlike reports via files, it always depicts the order's exact production status.

### Example: Order

| Item | Description | Work steps | Per lite | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Item 1:** | 15 x Float 5 mm | Cutting, Packing, Delivery | 3 | (15x3) = 45 |
| **Item 2:** | 20 x tempered glass 6 mm | Cutting, Arrissing, Toughening, Packing, Delivery | 5 | (20x5) = 100 |

The file-less production reports show the following details for this order as production progresses:

#### Example - view 1: 10 pcs. of item 1 have been cut

| Itm | Quantity | Open work steps | Last station Status | Next station |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 5 | 15 | - | Cutting |
| 1 | 10 | 20 | Cutting | Production | Packing |
| 2 | 20 | 100 | - | Cutting |

For item 1, 5 x 3 (cutting, packing, shipping), and 10 x 2 (packing, shipping) work steps are open.
For item 2, all of the 100 work steps are open.

#### Example - view 2: the five remaining pieces of item 1 have been cut

| Itm | Quantity | Open work steps | Last station Status | Next station |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 15 | 30 | Cutting | Production | Packing |
| 2 | 20 | 100 | - | Cutting |

For item 1, 15 x 2 (packing, shipping) work steps are open.
For item 2, all of the 100 work steps are open.

#### Example - view 3: 10 pieces of item 2 are on their way to the furnace while the remaining 10 pieces have been cut

| Itm | Quantity | Open work steps | Last station Status | Next station |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 15 | 30 | Cutting | Production | Packing |
| 2 | 10 | 40 | Cutting | Production | Grinding |
| 2 | 10 | 30 | Grinding | Production | Furnace 1 |

For item 2, 10 x 4 (grinding, furnace, packing, shipping) and 10 x 3 (furnace, packing, shipping) work steps are open.

Items that show no more open work steps will be removed from the view until no data are shown for the selected order.

The reported quantities will not be saved. This means that only the current state of production will be displayed.
