In the settings info that opens go to tab 2. Sorting:

criteria select supplier, delivery date supplier and order nu. Move them to the right with the arrow
button >. Keep in mind that the order of the criteria in the box to the left is important. It needs to
be like in the image below. You can change the order by using the arrow buttons below the box
