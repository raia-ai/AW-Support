long_description: "This document is a detailed tutorial chapter on managing surcharges within the A+W Business Master Data software, specifically for the glass industry. It is divided into three main sections: Group Surcharges, Replacement Surcharges, and Shape Processing Surcharges. The Group Surcharge section explains how to define, add, change, delete, and copy surcharges for groups of similar glass products, such as those with the same thickness. It provides step-by-step instructions with UI screenshots to guide the user through allocating products to price groups and setting up various surcharge parameters. The Replacement Surcharge section details the process for handling pricing when an element in a Bill of Materials (BOM), like a specific type of glass in an Insulating Glass (IG) unit, is substituted. It covers independent, thickness-related, and product-related surcharges, explaining their function and how to configure them in the system, including copying and changing them. The tutorial concludes with an introduction to Shape Processing Surcharges and exercises to reinforce the concepts. The tutorial is designed to ensure accurate and automated pricing for complex product configurations and material exchanges."
