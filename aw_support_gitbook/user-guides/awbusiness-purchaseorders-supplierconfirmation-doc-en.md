long_description: "This document is a comprehensive user tutorial for the A+W Business Purchasing software module. It provides step-by-step instructions on managing the entire purchase order lifecycle. The guide begins by explaining how to view reference documents for orders and P.O.s using the 'Order and P.O. info' function. It then details the process of creating manual purchase orders, distinguishing between 'Independent P.O.s' for general products and 'Stock P.O.s' specifically for replenishing inventory. The tutorial covers entering an independent P.O., creating a stock P.O. for items like boxes, and searching for stock articles. Following P.O. creation, the guide explains how to manage supplier order confirmations (OCs), including entering OCs for entire P.O.s or for individual items, handling partial deliveries, and booking the receipt of goods. It also covers the critical process of checking and confirming prices against the supplier's OC. Furthermore, the document addresses communication with suppliers, such as sending reminders for overdue deliveries or confirmations, and managing delivery date changes. It outlines how to check and correct delivery dates and notify customers of any delays. The tutorial is supported by numerous screenshots of the software interface, with key fields and functions clearly labeled to guide the user through each process."
