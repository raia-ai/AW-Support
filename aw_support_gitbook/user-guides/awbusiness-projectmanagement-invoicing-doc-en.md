long_description: "This document serves as a tutorial and reference guide for the A+W Business Master Data module, focusing on advanced project and invoice management features. The first major section, 'Extended Project Management,' details how to define projects with specific terms (e.g., payment terms), allocate them to customers, and track accumulated totals against estimated quantities. It guides the user through setting project validity, salesmen, and payment terms. The second section, 'Invoice Management with Allocated Orders,' explains the workflow for handling blanket orders. This includes creating a blanket order, issuing work orders against it, creating partial invoices (claims), and finally completing and invoicing the entire blanket order. The process is illustrated with workflow diagrams and step-by-step instructions. The latter half of the document is a comprehensive reference section. 'Available Document Types' lists and describes various document types used in the system, such as In-house production, Receivables, and Complaints. 'Available Limit Types' provides a detailed multi-page table of fixed limits for price definitions, covering everything from dimensions and thickness to quantities and surcharges. 'Available System Text' and 'Available Variables (Wildcards)' provide reference tables for system-generated text strings and dynamic variables that can be used in documents and reports, including general variables, processing variables, and spacer text variables."
