long_description: "This document is a detailed tutorial and reference guide for the A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software. It is part of a larger manual, focusing specifically on advanced sketching techniques and automation features. The tutorial section provides a series of hands-on exercises (16 to 23) that guide the user through creating complex shapes with features like rounded corners, multiple arcs, keyholes, and various cut-outs. Each exercise includes a task description with a target drawing, a step-by-step solution, and a list of the necessary tools. Following the exercises, the manual delves into the concepts of 'Macros and Templates.' It explains how to create, save, and use cut-out macros to group processing steps (like drill holes and cut-outs) for efficient reuse. It also covers creating templates with variable dimensions for frequently used sheet structures, which can be integrated with the A+W Business ERP system. The guide is intended for CAD operators and technical users who need to master the software for production purposes, emphasizing practical application and workflow efficiency."
