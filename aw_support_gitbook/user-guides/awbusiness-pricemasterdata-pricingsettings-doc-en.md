long_description: "This comprehensive tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and managing pricing structures in the A+W Business software system. It begins with an overview of the company-level price calculation parameters, which serve as the standard for all pricing unless overridden. The document then delves into the process of editing rates, which are combinations of price lists and price keys, and explains how to define and delete them. A significant portion of the guide is dedicated to creating and managing price tables. It details different pricing methodologies, including unit prices for single items, shape prices as surcharges for non-rectangular lites, and grill prices for complex patterns. The tutorial also covers the concept of graduated prices, which use limit types (vector, matrix, cube) to define prices based on criteria like size, thickness, or quantity. Advanced topics such as the PGR External Key for group-based pricing and the powerful copy/change function for efficiently updating price lists for a new year or different customers are also explained. The document is supplemented with numerous screenshots of the software interface, clearly labeling key fields and options to guide the user through each process. Exercises are included to help users practice the concepts covered."
