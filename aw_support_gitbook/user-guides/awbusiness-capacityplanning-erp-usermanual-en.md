## Automatic Scheduling

For automatic scheduling, the machines allocated to the corresponding work type will be selected. Several machines can be allocated to a work type, e.g. several drills to work type Drilling. The combination of work type and machine results in the time required (reserved capacity) and the costs. The automatic selection of the drilling machine is - among other things- based on the free capacities, technical restrictions, and costs.

The selection of a machine can therefore be controlled using the following settings:
*   Priority of the machine (9 to -2)
*   Work type
*   Locking of the machine, e.g. for particular product types
*   Restrictions that refer to the requirements from the order position, e.g. the dimensions, quantity.

In the following two figures, you can see how these settings work together. Priorities and restrictions are then described in detail in separate units.
