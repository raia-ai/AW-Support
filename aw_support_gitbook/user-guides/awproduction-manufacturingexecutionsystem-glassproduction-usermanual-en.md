## Overview Production Terminal: IG
This set of topics introduces the user interface and operation of Production Terminal IG (Terminal IG).

This subject area includes the following training sessions:
- Using Production Terminal IG-In
- Using Production Terminal IG-Assembly
- Using Production Terminal IG-Out

### Using Production Terminal IG-In

**Objectives**
- Introducing the user interface of Production Terminal IG-In.
- Getting to know and understanding the operation
- Correct handling of intermissions
- Being able to handle unforeseeable situations (e.g. shortage in material)

**Benefit**
Production Terminal IG-In supports you when it comes to loading the lites of a unit from rack to the IG line in the correct sequence. To work efficiently you have to understand the functioning of the program; you must also be capable of handling daily recurring situations.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Barcode** | Are opto-electronically readable signs consisting of parallel lines and gaps of different width. |
| **Batch** | Amount of items scheduled and produced together. |
| **Lot** | Amount of parts that are processed together on the same machine. |
| **Remake batch**| Lite that has been recut due to rejects or a defect. Amount of goods with identical properties. Example: a barrel of butyl. Amount of goods with identical properties. Example: a barrel of butyl. |
| **Rejects** | Defective lite that cannot be used. |
| **Production number** | Defines/shows the production sequence within a batch. Example: production number 22 is the 22nd IG unit to be produced. |
| **Scanning** | The term Scanning defines the registration of one or more barcodes. |
| **Book** | The Booking process writes and saves certain data in the database. |

**Note**

| Term | Note |

### Module Presentation: Production Terminal IG-In
Production Terminal IG-In shows all batches available at the line entrance where they can be selected. Information supporting the production of the lites is displayed as well. This includes graphic displays of the lite shapes and sizes, order and customer information, gas or muntins in the airspace, plus a preview of the units to be produced next.

When Production Terminal IG-In is started, the following view appears. To understand things better, the following screenshot already shows entries. When you start the module the main window will of course be empty.
