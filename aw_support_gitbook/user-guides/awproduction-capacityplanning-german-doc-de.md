long_description: "This document is a detailed tutorial and software reference for the A+W Production capacity planning software, written in German. It guides users through various modules essential for production planning and scheduling. The tutorial part starts with instructions on how to create, edit, and delete capacity reservations for specific customers or objects, including setting percentage-based reservations. It then moves on to 'Bearbeitungserzeugung' (processing generation), explaining how to supplement the bill of materials with production-relevant work steps by assigning processing articles to part types. A significant portion of the document is dedicated to master data management for capacity planning ('Stammdaten der Kapazitätsplanung'). This includes detailed instructions on setting up shifts and shift plans, defining non-working days in the calendar, creating shift rules and shift groups, and assigning machines. It also covers cost calculation ('Kostenkalkulation') for logical machines, defining setup times and transition times ('Übergangszeiten') between different machines or work steps, and setting up standard times ('Vorgabezeiten') using complex formulas and vectors. The second part of the document is a software reference ('Softwarereferenz') which provides a detailed overview of the 'Produktionsmonitor' (Production Monitor) and its related dialogs for scheduling ('Einlastung'), filtering, and configuration. The document includes numerous screenshots and step-by-step instructions to facilitate user learning and serves as a comprehensive guide for both new and experienced users."
