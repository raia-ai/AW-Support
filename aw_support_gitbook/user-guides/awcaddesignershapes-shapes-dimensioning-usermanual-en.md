## Dimensioning the sketch

There is a variety of tools for dimensioning sketches. The following are those that are necessary to dimension the example shape. For a list of the dimensioning tools, please refer to:

*   ⇨ "Dimensioning tools" on page A-249
*   ⇨ "Segment dimensioning" on page A-252
*   ⇨ "Dimensioning of angles" on page A-268
*   ⇨ "Dimensioning of circles and arcs" on page A-275
*   ⇨ "Automatic dimensioning" on page A-288

The following sizes are necessary to dimension a sketch completely:

`3 * number of arcs`
`+ 2 * number of straight lines`
`- 3`
`= number of contour sizes required`

1.  Start by dimensioning the reference edge. Select the displayed tool, click on the corresponding segment, and enter the size (444,20).
