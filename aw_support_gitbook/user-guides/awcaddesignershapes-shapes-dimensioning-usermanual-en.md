short_description: "A technical guide for using A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) software. It covers essential functions like dimensioning sketches, creating complex contours, adding cut-outs and holes, and working with variables and architectural glass."
long_description: "This document is a comprehensive user manual for A+W CAD Designer (Shapes), focusing on the 'Tools' and 'Fixed Questions' sections. It provides step-by-step instructions for dimensioning sketches, including referencing tools and calculating required sizes. The manual details the process of creating complex shapes by dimensioning individual points, formatting sizes, and entering radii. It explains how to add cut-outs and holes to a design, such as a door, by creating, dimensioning, and positioning them. The guide also covers the creation of complex contours by building and connecting smaller elements. A significant portion is dedicated to 'Working with shapes' and 'Working with variables,' explaining how to define shapes with variables, handle geometric peculiarities, and use arithmetic expressions and logical distinctions for dynamic designs. The manual concludes with instructions on processing lites, defining edgework, working with architectural glass (laminated and IG units), and integrating with other A+W programs like Enterprise and Business for a complete workflow from design to production. It also touches upon printing sketches and using templates."

## Dimensioning the sketch

There is a variety of tools for dimensioning sketches. The following are those that are necessary to dimension the example shape. For a list of the dimensioning tools, please refer to:

*   ⇨ "Dimensioning tools" on page A-249
*   ⇨ "Segment dimensioning" on page A-252
*   ⇨ "Dimensioning of angles" on page A-268
*   ⇨ "Dimensioning of circles and arcs" on page A-275
*   ⇨ "Automatic dimensioning" on page A-288

The following sizes are necessary to dimension a sketch completely:

`3 * number of arcs`
`+ 2 * number of straight lines`
`- 3`
`= number of contour sizes required`

1.  Start by dimensioning the reference edge. Select the displayed tool, click on the corresponding segment, and enter the size (444,20).
