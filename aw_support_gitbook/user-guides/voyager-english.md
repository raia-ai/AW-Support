Voyager 1202g
Wireless Single-Line Laser Scanner
Honeywell’s Voyager™ 1202g single-line laser scanner incorporates the
freedom of Bluetooth® wireless technology and offers a field-replaceable
battery that can be quickly and easily exchanged. The new 1202g delivers
the aggressive linear bar code scanning that users have come to expect
from the world-renowned Voyager family of scanners.

Voyager 1202g incorporates a Bluetooth® Class 2, v2.1 radio, enabling
unrestricted movement up to 10 meters (33 feet) from the base.
Honeywell has also demonstrated Bluetooth® Class 2 communication
ranges of up to 30 meters (100 feet) with a clear line of sight from
the base. The 1202g offers users added safety and a wider range of
movement by eliminating tethered cables. For added convenience, the
included paging system helps locate misplaced scanners with visual
and auditory signals.

The field-removable battery can be exchanged quickly and easily, without
the use of tools. The user-preferred, long-lasting Lithium ion battery
provides 12 hours or more of scanning time and 45,000 scans per
charge. The 1202g recharges quickly, resulting in increased throughput.

Built on the platform of the corded Voyager 1200g, the 1202g is optimized
for scanning linear bar codes, including poorly printed and damaged
codes. Voyager 1202g allows enterprises to minimize manual data entry,
leading to increased productivity and reduction in errors.

This plug and play scanner incorporates a multi-interface design with
automatic interface detection. Voyager 1202g automatically configures
itself to the appropriate interface, shortening the installation process.
1202g’s easy installation will benefit users in environments such as retail
stores, hospitals, and light manufacturing facilities. The base can be
desk or wall mounted to accommodate a variety of workstation layouts.
