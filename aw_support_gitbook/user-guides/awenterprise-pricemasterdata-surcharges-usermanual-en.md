long_description: "This document serves as both a tutorial and a software reference for the 'Prices and Conditions' module of A+W Enterprise. The tutorial section guides users through the process of setting up and managing price master data. It covers a wide range of topics, including defining vector prices for items like drillings, setting base prices for LAMI lites, and creating complex exchange and additional price lists for Insulating Glass (IG) and laminated products. The tutorial also details the configuration of muntin prices, various types of surcharges (e.g., shape, size, oversize, processing group), and the application of global price changes. A significant portion is dedicated to explaining the hierarchy and application of pricing 'Conditions,' from general daily conditions to specific customer, product, or article-level rules. The second part of the document is a detailed Software Reference, providing a structured overview of all menus, dialogs, and fields related to prices and conditions. It covers Price Keys, IG Prices, PCd Prices, Surcharges, and Price Control, offering field-level descriptions for each setting. The final section covers Cost Calculation, explaining how material, machine, and personnel costs are determined and managed within the system."

## Price Master Data

5. Specify the glass thickness (C), e.g. **99**.
   Note that this thickness is the upper limit value. The price is calculated up to this thickness.

6. Specify the quantity, e.g. **1**.
   Note that the price is calculated starting with this quantity of processings per lite, e.g. 5 drillings on a lite.

7. Use `<F2>` to change to the detail view in order to complete the settings.
