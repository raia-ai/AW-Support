It covers topics such as creating basic and complex constructions, managing master data for different bar types, using snap points, dimensioning, creating special patterns like facades and macros, and handling data exchange (import/export). The Software Reference section serves as a detailed encyclopedia of all software functions, dialogs, and settings, providing in-depth explanations for every feature. This manual is intended for users with basic computer and Windows knowledge and aims to enable them to efficiently create and manage bar designs from simple grids to intricate, custom motifs."
