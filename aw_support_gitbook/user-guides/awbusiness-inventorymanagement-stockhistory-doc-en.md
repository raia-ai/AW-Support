The document is structured to guide users through the various 'Queries' and management functions available. It begins with 'Stock History,' explaining how to select and view historical booking data based on different criteria like booking type, article, or date. It then moves to 'Stock Statistics,' which provides tools for analyzing stock performance, identifying hits and slow-sellers, and understanding stock turnover. This section covers the Products, Statistics, and FIFO/LIFO tabs, detailing how to set analysis criteria and interpret the resulting data, including calculations for opening/closing stock, additions, dispatches, and average storage time. The guide also explains how to manage 'Reserved Stock Products,' allowing users to see which articles are reserved for specific orders. Another key area is 'Stock Search,' which enables users to check current and future stock on hand. Finally, the document covers 'Stock P.O.' for managing purchase order suggestions and 'Inventory Assessment' for calculating stock values using methods like FIFO, LIFO, and average purchase price.
