long_description: "This tutorial provides detailed instructions for managing core master data within the A+W Business software system. The document is divided into three main sections: Customer Data, Supplier Data, and Product Data. The Customer Data section explains how to create and manage projects, including setting validity periods for order entry. The Supplier Data section details the process of entering and maintaining supplier information, highlighting differences from customer data, and explaining the use of the supplier file to allocate products and define standard suppliers for purchasing. The largest section, Product Data, offers a comprehensive guide to product management. It introduces fundamental concepts like product types and product groups, and explains how they form a hierarchical structure used for pricing, production, and statistical analysis. It covers the creation of Product Group (PGR) combinations to handle complex scenarios like products with multiple processing steps (e.g., IG units with grills) and provides detailed rules and examples for these combinations. The tutorial also covers the definition of quantity units, size calculations, and rounding rules essential for pricing and order entry."
