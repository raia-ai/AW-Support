long_description: "This comprehensive software reference guide details the functionalities of the A+W Production application, with a specific focus on its advanced Scheduling and Capacity Planning features. The document is structured to provide both high-level overviews and in-depth, step-by-step instructions for various tasks. Key sections include Scheduling, which covers dialog scheduling for order imports, BOM (Bill of Materials) configuration for analysis and manipulation, and extensive rescheduling capabilities for orders and batches. It explains how to handle post-processing for orders that were not scheduled correctly, including defective orders and asynchronous processing issues. The manual also covers the management of Campaigns and Reservations, allowing users to define and reserve capacities for specific work processes, customers, or projects. Another major section is dedicated to Time Master Data, which is crucial for calculating the duration of processing steps. This includes setting up default times, creating complex time formulas using the formula editor, and defining transition times between machines. The guide also details the configuration of Master Data for Shifts, including creating shift calendars, plans, rules, and groups, and assigning machines to them. The final part of the document consists of practical Help Cards, which offer tutorial-style workflows for common tasks like creating shift plans, defining cost records, integrating new machines, and rescheduling processing and dispatch dates. These cards provide clear objectives, prerequisites, and workflow steps, making the document an essential tool for both new and experienced users of A+W Production."
