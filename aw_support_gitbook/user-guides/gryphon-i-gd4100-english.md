GRYPHON™ I GD4100


ADVANCED READING PERFORMANCE
The Gryphon™ product series from
Datalogic represents the premium level
of data collection equipment for general
purpose applications. The Gryphon I
linear imaging readers provide advanced
reading performance and decoding for a
wide variety of applications. The Gryphon
GD4100 readers’ ability to capture bar
codes from near contact to over 1.0 m /
3.2 ft increases productivity and
improves ergonomics for users. A wide
scan angle reads very wide codes and
renewed decoding capabilities increase
throughput on hard-to-read, poor or
damaged codes.

DATALOGIC’S ‘GREEN SPOT’ IMPROVES
PRODUCTIVITY
Datalogic’s exclusive patented ‘Green
Spot’ for good-read feedback directly
on the code is ideal under dim lighting
conditions or noisy environments.
The Green Spot, together with the fast
reading and decoding capabilities make
the Gryphon I GD4100 readers the best
choice to improve productivity in retail
and office environments, hospitals,
