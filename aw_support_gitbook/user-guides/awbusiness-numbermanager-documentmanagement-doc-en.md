# Number Manager

---
## Objectives
- Getting familiar with the function of a number manager.
- Creating and filling in a number manager.
- Copying a document to a number manager.

## Benefits
- You can use a number manager to organize the process when working with documents.
- Functions can be executed for several documents at once without the need to open the individual documents.

## Note

**Organization**
Number managers are organizational units in which several documents are collected to be edited together. Orders are collected by delivery date for example in order to be transferred to capacity planning or production.

**Number managers cannot be blank**
A new number manager must be allocated to at least one document. The number manager cannot be saved without a document.

**Editing a number manager**
Using the number managers will not change the individual documents.

**Number manager in A+W Business modules**
The number manager dialog is the same for all documents.

**Collecting documents**
Functions for documents with an identical status can be triggered via number managers, e. g. the printing of delivery notes.

**Default settings**
None

# Document Organization

Every document is automatically allocated to a number manager. You can create different number managers and allocate them e. g. to certain employees or work areas such as order entry, production, dispatch, etc. Number managers can be used to automate work processes in the sales area, e. g. creating purchase orders or printing delivery notes.
