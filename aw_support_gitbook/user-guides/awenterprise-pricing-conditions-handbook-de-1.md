short_description: "This document serves as a comprehensive tutorial and reference manual for managing prices, conditions, and cost calculations within the A+W Enterprise software. It covers the setup of master data for various pricing models, including variant prices, glazing prices, vector prices, and machining prices. The manual also details the hierarchy and application of conditions, from general daily conditions to specific customer or item conditions. Finally, it explains the principles of cost calculation, differentiating between material, machine, and personnel costs."
long_description: "This document is an extensive guide for the A+W Enterprise system, focusing on the complex modules for Prices, Conditions, and Cost Calculation. It is structured into two main parts: a hands-on tutorial and a detailed software reference. The tutorial section (pages C-601 to C-682) provides step-by-step instructions for creating and managing different pricing structures. This includes setting up variant prices for measurement-based articles, prices for glazing and sealing, vector pricing for groups of articles, and special prices for machining. It also covers exchange and additional prices for components in ISO and VSG glass, as well as pricing for muntin bars and various surcharges. The tutorial is supplemented with exercises to reinforce learning. The second major part is a software reference manual (starting from C-683), which begins with a detailed table of contents and provides in-depth descriptions of all menus, dialogs, and fields related to prices and conditions. It explains the concept of price keys (Preisschlüssel) like PLKZ and PKZ, the setup of price matrices, and the logic behind condition hierarchies, from general daily conditions down to specific prices for individual market partners or projects. The final section delves into cost calculation, explaining how material, machine, and personnel costs are determined and updated within the system, and how master data settings influence these calculations."
