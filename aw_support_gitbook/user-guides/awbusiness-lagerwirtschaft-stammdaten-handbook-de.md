long_description: "This document serves as a detailed tutorial for the A+W Business Lagerwirtschaft (Warehouse Management) software module. It is designed to guide users through the various configuration and operational steps required for effective inventory management. The tutorial is divided into several key sections, starting with the setup of master data (Stammdaten), which includes defining warehouse structures, levels, and categories. It then moves on to company data settings (Firmendaten), explaining how to configure inventory management modes, reservations, and status assignments that control how stock levels are updated. A significant portion of the manual is dedicated to product definition, detailing the differences between stock items, stock sizes, and bills of materials (BOMs). It explains how to configure products for different procurement types (e.g., purchase, production, stock withdrawal) and how to manage them at the BOM level. The tutorial also provides an in-depth look at pricing, covering a-average purchase price calculation, price determination logic via a flowchart, and the setup of various price lists. Further sections cover the core warehouse management functionalities, such as creating stock items, performing manual and automatic inventory postings (receipts, issues, transfers), and using various queries to monitor stock levels, history, and statistics. The document concludes with instructions on how to handle stock items within business documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders, including searching for available stock, checking future availability, and creating automatic or manual purchase orders. Throughout the tutorial, numerous screenshots of the user interface are provided to illustrate the steps, and supplementary exercises and information links are included to reinforce learning."
