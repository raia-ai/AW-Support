## Tutorial

### Documentation

The tutorial on A+W Capa View explains how you work with the visualization of the product capacities.

**Subjects**

This tutorial offers the following subjects:
- A+W Capa View
- Displaying data
- Operate program

**Required knowledge**

This tutorial is aimed at employees who require an overview of the current production, e.g. sales staff and employees entering orders. The prerequisite is knowledge of how to use a touchscreen. This specifically includes the following gestures: clicking, swiping, zooming in and zooming out. You can also use a mouse to operate this program.

**Reading tip**

The contents of a training module are based on the knowledge conveyed in the previous module. We therefore recommend you do not skip any modules.

**Display Conventions**

Certain parts of sentences are specially marked. The meanings are:

- **Italics**: are marked character strings that describe the elements of the software, e. g. the *Settings* selection.
- **Bold**: are marked sequences of symbols that you key in with the keyboard such as the number **0**.
- **>**: So-called "breadcrumb trails" mark the way in which you open a view, e. g. Documents > Order > Order > Functions > Capacity Overview.
- **[]**: Square brackets designate buttons in the dialog. For instance, you use [settings] to define the language.
- **<>**: Angled brackets designate buttons or combinations of buttons on your keyboard, such as updating your browser with <F5>.

## A+W Capa View

A+W Capa View is a service with a web-based interface to display data from A+W Production.

A+W Capa View can be launched in the latest version of any browser. The address to the requested server can be saved as a favorite or link on the desktop like all Internet addresses. In addition, you can open A+W Capa View directly in A+W Business (Document entry > Functions > Capacity overview). For A+W Dashboard, a new view type has been implemented in which you can include and display the views of A+W Capa View.

### The idea behind the program

A+W Capa View is a tool used to visualize the available capacities in Production and the production progress. It shows the shifts that have been created in A+W Capacity Planning. The number of unscheduled and scheduled capacities and the number of produced orders are shown within these shifts. You are also able to have the order and batch-related production progress displayed and are thus able to always provide your customers with up-to-date information about the orders.

*(Fig. 1 Monitor view (starting image))*

A+W Capacity Planning and the barcoding data are used for the display. Accordingly, A+W Capa View provides sales staff, for example, with a view of the current capacities in Production. Thus, sales staff directly on site at the customer can make a statement as to whether a large project, e.g. a construction project, can still be scheduled for a certain week.

Employees in Order Entry can set up links with preset views of bottleneck machines and can thus obtain a quick overview of production capacities. In addition, they can view order and batch-related production progress by double-clicking a shift.

> **Correct display only if barcoding bookings are correct**
> An up-to-date A+W Capacity Planning and complete barcoding bookings are required for informative displays.

*(Fig. 2 The system portfolio of A+W Software GmbH for the flat glass department)*

### View bottleneck machines

A+W Capa View shows all machines that have been defined in A+W Capacity Planning.

View the bottleneck machines to decide whether an order can still be produced in a certain week or not.

### Features

A+W Capa View shows the capacities of the machines and thus provides a high level of transparency.

A+W Capa View shows the order and batch-related production progress. Accordingly, you can always provide your customers with up-to-date information about orders.

In realtime, you receive information about individual machines, e.g. cutting, IG lines, processing, and TG production: You will see the unscheduled and scheduled capacities and already produced orders.

This program can be used both on large monitors in various production departments and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. However, this requires an internet browser and access to this program (address and user account). On mobile devices the screen display adjusts when the device is rotated.

Thus, A+W Capa View is used as an online monitoring tool and a means for decision-making that informs you in which week orders can be delivered and whether corresponding commitments can be made to the customer. Or it provides employees in Work Preparation a quick overview of production capacities.

In A+W Capa View, all the machines can be displayed that are defined in A+W Capacity Planning.

## Displaying data

The analyses of A+W Capacity Planning and the barcoding bookings are visualized in bar charts. The data is displayed in the Monitor View and in the Detail View.

### Monitor View

The Monitor View is the starting dialog in A+W Capa View. You can have data for machines or machine groups displayed on certain days and shifts.

*(Fig. 3 Bar chart in Monitor View (example))*

- **A** Time axis
- **B** Shift duration (colored in blue) in hours
- **C** Unscheduled capacities of a shift
- **D** Scheduled capacities of a shift
- **E** Already produced orders of a shift
- **F** Day
- **G** Shifts of the defined day

In this example, three shifts and their capacity utilization are displayed. The capacity utilization is shown in different colors:
- **blue**: unscheduled orders/items/batches
- **gray**: scheduled orders/items/batches
- **green**: already produced orders/items/batches

### Detailed View

For each shift, you can open the Detailed View.

*(Fig. 4 Detailed View (example))*
- **A** Shift overview
- **B** Batch or order overview

*(Fig. 5 Bar chart in Detailed View, top section.)*
- **A** Shift time in hours
- **B** Area in square meters
- **C** Number of pieces
- **D** Produced portion of shift
- **E** Scheduled portion of shift
- **F** Unscheduled portion of shift

In the top section of the Detailed View, three bars are displayed for the selected shift.
- Scheduled and unscheduled times of the shift and times in which production was executed.
- Scheduled, unscheduled and produced areas of the shift; unit: square meters.
- Scheduled, unscheduled and produced pieces of the shift; unit: pieces.

The bars are always displayed over the entire width of the window, which corresponds to the entire time, area or pieces of the corresponding shift.

*(Fig. 6 Bar chart in Detailed View, bottom section)*

Select for the bottom section of the Detailed View whether the data should be shown batch or order-related. You can choose the criteria for displaying the data:
- Time in hours
- Pieces
- Quantity in square meters

The employee can see how much has been produced already from the corresponding orders. During a shift, the gray bars, i.e. scheduled capacities, turn into green bars, i.e. already produced capacities.

> **Correct display only if barcoding bookings are correct**
> You need complete barcoding bookings for a meaningful Detailed View.

## Operate program

A+W Capa View can be operated with both the touchscreen and the mouse.
