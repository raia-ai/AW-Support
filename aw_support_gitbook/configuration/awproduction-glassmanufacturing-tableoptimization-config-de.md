long_description: "This is a comprehensive software reference manual for the A+W Realtime Optimizer, a system designed for the glass manufacturing industry. The document provides detailed instructions on various modules and settings. The first part covers the 'Tischoptimierung' (Table Optimization) settings, which allow users to control whether the production date is displayed. It then explains the 'Ansicht' (View) menu, including functions for starting and stopping data imports (`Import`), viewing system error messages (`Fehlermeldungen`), and managing the status bar. The core of the document is a detailed guide to the 'A+W Residual Stock Manager,' a module for managing residual glass plates (rest-sheets). It explains how to configure warehouses (`Lager`), storage locations (`Abstellplätze`), and racks (`Gestelle`) through the A+W Planning Web interface. The guide details all configuration fields, such as ID, designation, access type (FIFO, LIFO), and physical constraints (weight, dimensions). It also covers the 'Glasübersicht' (Glass Overview) screen, where users can view, filter, edit, and manually add stored residual sheets. The manual concludes with an alphabetical index for quick reference to all topics covered."
