long_description: "This software reference guide details the configuration options available in the 'Forms' section of the A+W Business Master Data module. It is broken down into several key areas. The 'Form Management' section explains how to control the printing of order items, including headers, Bill of Materials (BOM), prices, and document archiving. It details the settings in 'Options 1' and 'Options 2' tabs, which allow for fine-tuned control over what information appears on printed documents. The 'Sketch Printing' section describes how to configure the size, position, and text for shape and grill sketches on forms, requiring the A+W CAD Designer. The 'Customizing' tab allows for defining where specific paragraphs start on a form. The guide also covers 'Order Forms' for direct printing, 'Print Jobs' for automating and sequencing print tasks via a print server, and the integration of 'Crystal Reports' for custom reporting. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of the 'CEKAL' module, which is used by French companies to manage quality certification criteria for IG units, including defining classes, assigning values to products, and generating specific texts for documentation."
