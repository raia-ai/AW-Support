long_description: "This document provides a step-by-step tutorial for setting up a new calendar year in the A+W Business (AWB) software. It is intended for system administrators or users responsible for managing master data. The process begins with navigating to the Calendar section within the Master Data module. Users are then guided on how to create a new calendar entry, define the standard working week (e.g., Monday to Friday, 8 hours per day), and apply these settings to the entire year. The guide also explains how to handle exceptions, such as company holidays or vacation periods. It demonstrates how to select a specific week, modify the working hours for particular days (e.g., setting them to zero for Christmas holidays), and apply these changes to just that week. The process is illustrated with screenshots from the AWB interface, highlighting key buttons and fields like 'New', 'Save', 'Apply to year', and 'Apply to week'."
