### 3.2. Description

A+W Production Terminal (EL) handles production control at various points in the production flow. The basic functions of A+W Production Terminal (EL) include the display of information about the sheets to be produced, the reporting "completed" of processings, and breakage entry.

On the largest part of the screen, a CAD image is displayed for the sheets to be produced.

On the left side of the screen, the quantities are entered that you would like to report completed. Furthermore, the BOM tree for the selected item is displayed. Here, glass items are displayed in blue and the processings for the selected machine in red.

The lower part of the screen displays additional information about the selected item in a table. The user can change the content of this table. Here, you can change the sequence and add or remove fields from a pre-selection. A table once set up can be saved under its own name and then called up again as needed.

### 3.3. Requirements

The A+W Production Terminal (EL) requires the following A+W products:

*   A+W Business Pro installation with licensed A+W Business Capa.
*   A+W Business Pro database in Microsoft SQLServer.
*   A+W Business Interface Service to process the bookings.
*   A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) to display the geometry, a A+W CAD Designer (Shapes) license is not necessary. A CAD drawing is required, it can be generated by A+W Business using the appropriate modules (TOE) for which a license is required.

### 3.4. List of functions

The following functions are mapped:

*   Booking of completion report for sheets for the production step
*   Breakage report of sheets with breakage reason and breakage location
*   Display of CAD images via A+W CAD Designer (Shapes). CAD files are necessary for this; they are generated by A+W Business.
*   Load sheets via scanning of a bar code and the search via input of the order, item, and part number
*   Schematic display of the BOM of the glass unit
*   Additional information about the sheet displayed in a table

### 3.5. Restrictions

The product is subject to the following restrictions:

*   Bookings on racks are not supported
*   No individual sheet tracing is supported, only quantitative completed messages on the machines
*   There is no search by batch number, rack, etc. - only the search via order, item, and part
*   The assembly of products (e.g. assembly of FLOAT sheets in an IGU) is not supported.
*   There are no terminals for the input or output on a machine. Thus, no bookings are possible for this state. A booking always means that the sheet was produced on this machine.
*   Only keyboard scanners are supported.
*   Partial bookings (e.g. only 2 of 4 holes) are not possible.
*   The automatic ordering of broken sheets that are ordered is not possible.
*   The display and performance (functions, which ones are integrated and available via the operating elements of the interface) in A+W Production Terminal (EL) are specified permanently and they cannot be adjusted or expanded.
