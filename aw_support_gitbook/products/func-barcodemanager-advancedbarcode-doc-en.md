### 3.2. Description

The A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode allows you to print labels with a unique barcode per lite. This prevents the same label being booked more than once per registration point.

### 3.3. List of functions

The functionality of the A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode allows each glass to be booked individually with an individual glass barcode. This results in the following advantages:

*   The system allows to control the glasses individually (single lite barcoding)
*   Accidental double bookings of the same glass on the same machines are avoided
*   The barcodes are often shorter and therefore easier to remember and recognize

The barcodes can be read with the A+W Business Scanner and the A+W Business Production Terminal (EL).

### 3.4. Restrictions

This section is intentionally left blank in the source document.

### 3.5. Notes

To use the A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode, the new Crystal Reports labels with an activated unique barcode are required.

This extension is available only in connection with A+W Business or A+W Business Pro and A+W Barcode Manager (EL).
