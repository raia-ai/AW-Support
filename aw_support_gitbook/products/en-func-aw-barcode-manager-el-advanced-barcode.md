 Module                    A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode
 Brief description         Module for printing labels with unique barcode per

3.2. Description
The A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode allows you to print labels with a unique
barcode per lite. This prevents the same label being booked more than once per registration
point.


3.3. List of functions
The functionality of the A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode allows each glass to be
booked individually with an individual glass barcode. This results in the following advantages:
    •   The system allows to control the glasses individually (single lite barcoding)
    •   Accidental double bookings of the same glass on the same machines are avoided
    •   The barcodes are often shorter and therefore easier to remember and recognize
The barcodes can be read with the A+W Business Scanner and the A+W Business Production
Terminal (EL).


3.4. Restrictions

3.5. Notes
To use the A+W Barcode Manager (EL) - Advanced Barcode, the new Crystal Reports labels with
an activated unique barcode are required.
This extension is available only in connection with A+W Business or A+W Business Pro and A+W
Barcode Manager (EL).
