   Inventory
3.7.1. Requirements
In order to be able to use the expansion, the A+W Smart Companion - Basic License and A+W

into the production module. In order to be able to use it, it must be enabled in the infrastructure
(per site).


3.7.2. List of functions
    •   Reprint rack labels directly on the shop floor. Here, the label layout must be stored with
        SAP Crystal Reports.

    •   Adjustment of the rack type. If, e.g. behind the scanned barcode, there is no A-rack, but
        rather an L-rack, this can be changed directly in the app. The change is made in the A+W
        Production master data.
    •   Compliance with technical inspections for racks. In Germany, a TÜV inspection of the rack
        is required every 2 years (rust, weld seams, etc.). This time period can be configured at
        will. In the app, it is simply confirmed that the check has been done for the scanned rack
        and the inspection interval is reset. Information is attached to the rack master data in
        A+W Production.
        The inspection is integrated into Smart Companion Production. If an employee scans a
        rack that has no valid inspection, an appropriate message is displayed. Furthermore, the
        user can see from the symbol that the rack has no valid inspection. This information is
        also visible in the device's log and on the rack info page.
