3.1. Data
 Product                  A+W Production
 Module number            221019
 Module                   A+W Rack Optimizer
 Brief description        With this module, sheets in the manufacturing area can be
                          directly loaded onto transport racks.
 Available                Starting with A+W Production v5


3.2. Description
With A+W Rack Optimizer, sheets in the manufacturing area can be directly loaded onto transport
racks. The 3D view of the racks on an A+W Production Terminal shows the required packing
sequence.
Rack optimization automatically defines the proper production sequence within the framework of
detailed scheduling with regard to the loading sequence. The loading of the racks is displayed and
can be edited if necessary.


3.3. Requirements
The use of A+W Rack Optimizer requires the following software modules:
    •   A+W Production (core module)
    •   A+W Production Terminal (for the graphic display of racks)


3.4. List of functions
    •   The rack optimization A+W Rack Optimizer guides the entire production process toward
        direct packaging and the best possible utilization of packaging. Thus, re-sorting in dispatch
        and the intermediate storage is unnecessary.
    •   The orders are divided into groups to be packaged together, e.g.:
        - Same delivery date
        - Same route
        - Same shipping address
    •   After executing the rack optimization, it is possible to display the results in a suitable editor
        (how will the sheets be placed on the transport rack?).
    •   The optimized racks can be repacked with a few mouse-clicks if necessary.
    •   Not just the correct transport rack is displayed on the A+W Production Terminal monitor at
        the end of the line, but also the position of the sheet on the rack.

    •   Deep integration with A+W Enterprise: here you can define the rules for packing and
        shipping order-related.


3.5. Limitations
    •   Racks planned by A+W Rack Optimizer must be available physically in the appropriate
        quantity.


3.6. Notes
Of course with production organized this way, waste does not increase or only increases
minimally.
It's easiest to do this with the help of harp racks and/or automated sorting aids. A-rack solutions
are also possible, but due to the large number of optimization restrictions, they requires a larger
intermediate buffer in cutting. Nevertheless, if you are using A+W Rack Optimizer, you will find
that you have significantly more space than before.
